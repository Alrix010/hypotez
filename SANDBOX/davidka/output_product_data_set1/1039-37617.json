Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon.

Because of the way safety is maintained by complying with code, regarding ground neutral bonding, I wanted to switch that would disconnect not just the hots, but also the neutral in the ground so I could maintain my solar inverter system as the source of ground because it is the source of power and still leave my portable generator bonded without creating two neutral ground bonds in one system . This switch allowed me to do that for my 3000W system with a positive disconnect of the neutral and ground.\n\nRead more\n\n2 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport\n\nGreg Carr\n\n1.0 out of 5 stars It doesn't work...that's really good to know.\n\nReviewed in the United States on April 13, 2025\n\nSize: 8 Terminals 20AVerified Purchase\n\nPoorly constructed. I've been in the Electrical business for 40+ years and have extensive experience with Hand-Off-Auto switches. When this switch failed to operate (no make or break contacts in any switch position) I decided to disassemble and see why. What I found was the gap in the Cam (see picture) is not wide enough for the full travel of the switch positions. Even though I was extra careful, unfortunately I lost a contact assembly and this is now junk.

I put led lights up on the tire rack to shine down on the bed and put some led lights by the ramp loading area and under the front to help with hitch hookup in dark. I needed a waterproof enclosed switch to handle the 12vdc switching. The Product: The enclosure is compact, which is great until you try to get it all to fit inside and then screw the cover on; watch your wire length and test fit before mounting. The box itself has 4 mounting holes in the back and they include silicone o rings to seal those up. There is an o ring for the front cover too. There are 2 knock outs for wiring, they include the screw in bushings with gaskets and tapered seal too. Nice touch. Be sure to put silicone (not included) on the seals. As for the comment about instructions, none packed in the box. Pretty intuitive though. I took out my multimeter to figure out the connections. There is a position 1, position 0 which is off, and position 2 on the switch. There are terminals on top (for position 1) and on the bottom (for position 2). How those work: for position 1 on the switch, you have 2 input terminals, call those 1A and 2A. When you flip the switch from 0 Off to 1 On, 1A connects to 3A and 2A connects to 4A. There is no continuity between 1A or 2A, nor between 3A and 4A. I needed 1A and 2A to share same input voltage wire, so I made a jumper wire and put it between 1A and 2A and then when I turn on the switch, both 3A and 4A output the same. All of this repeats with another set of terminals for position 2. And there is no continuity between switch position 1 and position 2. There are also 2 common terminal rails inside the enclosure as well those came in handy. I added an external connector to power my lights from a battery when the trailer is not connected to the tow vehicle too\nMoreHide\nCustomer Image\nThank you for your feedback\nClose\nSorry, there was an error\nClose\nSorry we couldn't load the review\nTry again\nTop reviews from the United States\nThere was a problem filtering reviews.

It was NOT easy. This is a 20A switch, which means you'll need to use 12 AWG wire. But it works as advertised!\nFor my project, I wanted the switch to be able to switch from power from the inverter to power from the grid. That way, my devices (fridge and small electronics) in our camp trailer would be powered no matter the source.\nSo I needed wires coming in from the grid (two go into the box, ground wire stays outside the box)\nThen wires from the inverter (same deal, two into the plastic box, ground wire outside)\nThen four wires coming out of the box that lead the AC circuit breaker and house outlets, plus two ground wires outside the box.\nTo wire it all up, those four ground wires got secured with a large red wire nut (max four 12 AWG) and many more wire nuts to the rest of the connections outside the box.\nBut the connections inside the box were the hardest. Getting all those wires through the little cutout holes was tough enough, but then trying to jam the whole front faceplate and box together and screw it all together was harder. Gotta make sure that all your wire is stripped properly (no nicks in the insulation) and you have screwed down the terminals on the switch really well. Fortunately, despite the entire switch being made of plastic (except for the terminals and internal electrical connections obviously), it seems fairly durable for light use. I would not trust it in a really heavy duty situation where it could get kicked or hit, but protected and out of the way seems fine.\nSince this was in a mobile setting, I used stranded wire. Would probably have been easier with solid core wire. With the tight spaces in there, the risk was too great for a stray strand of wire to touch someplace it should not and cause a short, so I crimped ferrules onto the end of each wire and this made it SO MUCH easier and safer assembling it. Do yourself a favor and buy a kit with ferrules and ferrule crimper.\nLong story short, I ended up not using the back end of the plastic box. I just left it off and installed the faceplate part that holds the switch anyways onto some 1/2\" plywood. This made it way way way easier putting the whole thing together in still a tight space inside the camp trailer under the fridge\nRead more\n9 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSmartShopper\n5.0 out of 5 stars It works.\nReviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025\nSize: 2.6\"x2.6\"x3.35\"Verified Purchase\nIt works to let me switch my breaker box from grid power to my solar system.\nRead more\nHelpful\nReport\ntvjunky\n5.0 out of 5 stars Rotary switch\nReviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024\nSize: 3.15\"x3.15\"x3.7\"Verified Purchase\nThis is a very well built and nice switch.

It is very compact with the housing it comes with, so for a novice wiring it, they will be challenged! I like the compact size, and it works well.\nRead more\nHelpful\nReport\nOgilvie\n3.0 out of 5 stars Unsuitable as 20 amp changeover\nReviewed in the United States on February 17, 2023\nSize: 3.15\"x3.15\"x3.7\"Verified Purchase\nFor 20 amp the wire preferable is 14 awg. There is not the space in the housing for three cables (input and two outputs). Difficult to fit two cables, what I needed, not needing a changeover function. The housing is simply too small and only has cable entries for two cables. Switch itself seems robust and well designed except for two outputs bridging of the input is necessary whereas one would expect such bridging to be built in.\nRear of the housing as screw holes so free standing switch is not weatherproof.\nFits my purpose of mounted weather resistant 20 amp on/off switch so 3 stars due to poor housing sizing and consequent difficulty in wiring. For the function advertised would rate it as zero.\nRead more\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\nTop reviews from other countries\nTranslate all reviews to English\nChava\n5.0 out of 5 stars PequeÃ±o pero de gran calidad\nReviewed in Mexico on February 13, 2024\nSize: 3.15\"x3.15\"x3.7\"Verified Purchase\nMe funcionÃ³ perfecto para intercambiar entre 2 bombas centrifugas a 120V de 16 amperes, aunque el espacio es pequeÃ±o logrÃ© cablear todo con calibre 12 awg, el producto es de gran calidad y trae los accesorios necesarios para conexiÃ³n.

La protezione IP65 garantisce una certa protezione dalla polvere e dagli schizzi dâacqua, ma sconsiglio vivamente di posizionarlo sotto la pioggia diretta in quanto non Ã¨ a tenuta stagna.

Le viti dei terminali sono di acciaio inossidabile e garantiscono una forte presa sui cavi evitando allentamenti e rischi di corto circuito. La possibilitÃ  di sfruttare fino a 8 terminali, consente di collegare piÃ¹ apparecchiature selezionando con un solo movimento quelle che devono accendersi o spegnersi. Oltre che in corrente alternata, il deviatore puÃ² lavorare in corrente continua permettendo di gestire dispositivi elettronici per uso domestico. Per la versatilitÃ  e lâottimo rapporto qualitÃ /prezzo, il mio giudizio sul prodotto Ã¨ ampiamente positivo.
