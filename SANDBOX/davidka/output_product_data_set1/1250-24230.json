    "description": "Avtron AV5 SMARTach IIIâ¢ sensors are magnetoresistive, severe duty incremental quadrature sensors for the AV485, AV685, or AV850 rotary encoders. The AV5 is also usable in applications where an encoder housing is not needed â simply mount the AV5 with your bracket, and use an AV850 or other rotor. Also available: XR5 and XR12 sensors for hazardous duty applications or XP5 for applications where explosion proof is a requirement.\nThe AV5 is ideal for applications where mounting on a large diameter through-shaft is needed, including large hollow shafts for cooling water or air. The AV5 sensor + AV850 rotor combination permits through-shafts up to 4.5\" [115mm].\nThe AV5 offers a full range of electrical connector options, including IP67 cable, IP66 MS connectors, and IP65 Industrial with built-in terminal strips. The AV5 sensor is fully protected against all types of wiring errors, including short circuits, reverse voltage, and phase-to-phase shorts. It is one tough sensor! For larger bore applications, use AV12 sensors with the AV125 encoder (or as stand-alone).\nThe universal 5-24V design drives longer cables and is protected against wiring errors and surges.\nAdaptive Electronics: At power-up you know you installed it right! The green LED tells you your AV5 Sensor is aligned with the rotor and reading signal. If at any time, the AV5 cannot produce consistent signals, the LED changes to red and the optional remote alarm contact activates. However, the encoder keeps working to give you time to schedule service. Even wiring errors and short circuits that cause an over-temp situation will be detected and indicated by changing the LED to orange.",
