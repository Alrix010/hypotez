    "description": "The T Connector is our most popular and versatile structural pipe fitting. It is designed to natively fit electrical conduit which is readily available at your local hardware store. The 3/4\" and 1\" variants will clamp securely to their respective size. The 1/2\" connector variant includes two adapter shims for building with 1/2\" EMT Conduit. The T fitting allows you to easily connect two pipes at a 90 degree angle or use it as an elbow on the ends of conduit. You only need a single 5mm hex wrench for the T Connector assembly.",
