As one reviewer said, the hole in the brass lamp base needs to be enlarged. I did not have a step drill, but I was able to enlarge the opening with a small grinding wheel in my Dremel tool. Lamp now works great.\nRead more\nHelpful\nReport\nHenrietta Household\n5.0 out of 5 stars Working well as a replacement switch\nReviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025\nColor: Brass Plated FinishVerified Purchase\nWorks well as described\nRead more\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\nTop reviews from other countries\nE.
