        "I cut two sections of 3/4â EMT conduit as roof rack crossbars for my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. When the sunroof was open while driving, the tubing made a loud, deep tone. My suspicion was bottle-blowing noises due to the open tube ends. I ordered the Maker Pipe tube ends and they arrived really fast for Fairbanks, Alaska! The tube ends fit securely with a small amount of overlap in the outside diameter. Alas, plugging the ends didnât dampen the tone which now appears to be due to vibration of the crossbars in the wind. Nevertheless, the tube ends give my roof rack a finished look and keep water out. Thank you, Maker Pipe, for a fine product and excellent customer service!",
