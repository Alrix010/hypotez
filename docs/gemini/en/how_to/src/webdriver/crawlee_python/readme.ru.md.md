**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet defines a module-level docstring using reStructuredText (reST) for the `src.webdriver.crawlee_python` module. It serves as a documentation for the module's purpose, features, requirements, and configuration.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a module-level docstring, starting with a reST directive `.. module::` to specify the module name.
2. It provides a brief overview of the module's functionality, highlighting key features and requirements.
3. It includes a section outlining the module's configuration details, including the location of the configuration file (`crawlee_python.json`) and an example of its structure.
4. It explains each configuration field, its purpose, and its default value.
5. It demonstrates how to use the module in a project, providing a code example for initializing the `CrawleePython` class.
6. It explains the module's logging and debugging features, including the use of the `logger` from `src.logger`.
7. It concludes with the license information for the project.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.webdriver.crawlee_python import CrawleePython
import asyncio

# Initialize CrawleePython with custom options
async def main():
    crawler = CrawleePython(max_requests=10, headless=True, browser_type='chromium', options=["--headless"])
    await crawler.run([\'https://www.example.com\'])\

asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
