**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code defines a module for parsing HTML content using BeautifulSoup and XPath. It allows for loading HTML from files or URLs, parsing it, and extracting elements using XPath locators. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a module using `.. module::` directive, indicating it's a Python module. 
2. It provides a description of the module's functionality and its key features, including parsing HTML using BeautifulSoup and XPath, supporting files and URLs, allowing custom locators, and logging errors.
3. It outlines the required dependencies for the module and instructions for installing them using `pip`.
4. The code then defines the configuration settings for the parser, including default URL, file path, locator, logging settings, proxy settings, timeout, and encoding. 
5. The code provides examples of how to use the parser to load HTML from files and URLs, extract elements using locators, and utilize logging functionality. 
6. Finally, the code mentions the license under which the project is released. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.webdriver.bs import BS
from types import SimpleNamespace
from src.utils.jjson import j_loads_ns
from pathlib import Path

# Load settings from the configuration file
settings_path = Path('path/to/bs.json')
settings = j_loads_ns(settings_path)

# Initialize the BS parser with the default URL
parser = BS(url=settings.default_url)

# Use the default locator from the configuration
locator = SimpleNamespace(**settings.default_locator)
elements = parser.execute_locator(locator)
print(elements)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
