**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code defines the `Playwrid` class, which inherits from the `PlaywrightCrawler` class and provides additional functionality for interacting with websites using Playwright. It allows you to set custom launch options, profiles, and settings, and execute locators to interact with web elements.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: 
    - The `Playwrid` class is initialized with optional user-agent string, launch options, and Playwright crawler settings.
    - It sets up the Playwright executor and initializes the base crawler.
    - It configures launch options based on default settings and provided options.
2. **Starting the Crawler**: 
    - The `start()` method initiates the crawler and navigates to the specified URL.
    - It starts the Playwright executor, navigates to the URL, and runs the crawler.
    - It obtains the crawling context and stores it for further use.
3. **Interacting with Elements**: 
    - The class provides methods for various interactions, such as retrieving page content (`get_page_content()`, `get_element_content()`), retrieving element value (`get_element_value_by_xpath()`), clicking elements (`click_element()`), and executing locators (`execute_locator()`).
    - The `execute_locator()` method allows you to define locator data (such as CSS selector, XPath, and event) and execute it through the Playwright executor.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.webdriver.playwright.playwrid import Playwrid

async def main():
    browser = Playwrid(options=["--headless"])
    await browser.start("https://www.example.com")

    # Get the entire HTML content of the page
    html_content = browser.get_page_content()
    if html_content:
        print(html_content[:200])  # Print the first 200 characters for demonstration
    else:
        print("Failed to get HTML content.")

    # Get the HTML content of an element by selector
    element_content = await browser.get_element_content("h1")
    if element_content:
        print("\nContent of element h1:")
        print(element_content)
    else:
        print("\nElement h1 not found.")

    # Get the value of an element by XPath
    xpath_value = await browser.get_element_value_by_xpath("//head/title")
    if xpath_value:
        print(f"\nValue of element by XPath //head/title: {xpath_value}")
    else:
        print("\nElement by XPath //head/title not found")

    # Click on a button (if found)
    await browser.click_element("button")

    # Execute a locator to retrieve the name of a product
    locator_name = {
        "attribute": "innerText",
        "by": "XPATH",
        "selector": "//h1",
        "if_list": "first",
        "use_mouse": False,
        "timeout": 0,
        "timeout_for_event": "presence_of_element_located",
        "event": None,
        "mandatory": True,
        "locator_description": "Название товара"
    }

    name = await browser.execute_locator(locator_name)
    print("Name:", name)

    # Execute a locator to click on a button
    locator_click = {
        "attribute": None,
        "by": "CSS",
        "selector": "button",
        "if_list": "first",
        "use_mouse": False,
        "timeout": 0,
        "timeout_for_event": "presence_of_element_located",
        "event": "click()",
        "mandatory": True,
        "locator_description": "название товара"
    }
    await browser.execute_locator(locator_click)
    await asyncio.sleep(3)

asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
