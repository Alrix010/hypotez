**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines the `PlaywrightExecutor` class, which provides functionalities to interact with web elements using Playwright based on provided locators. It handles parsing locators, interacting with elements, and error handling.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** The `__init__` method initializes the Playwright executor, setting up the browser type and configuration.
2. **Start Browser:** The `start` method initializes Playwright and launches a browser instance.
3. **Stop Browser:** The `stop` method closes the Playwright browser and stops its instance.
4. **Execute Locator:** The `execute_locator` method is the core functionality, taking a locator (dict or SimpleNamespace) and executing actions based on its instructions. It parses the locator, handles attribute evaluation, retrieves elements, and executes events.
5. **Evaluate Locator:** The `evaluate_locator` method processes locator attributes, potentially converting them to lists or dictionaries.
6. **Get Attribute:** The `get_attribute_by_locator` method retrieves the specified attribute from the web element using the provided locator.
7. **Get WebElement:** The `get_webelement_by_locator` method locates the web element based on the locator information, considering options like `if_list` to select specific elements from a list.
8. **Get Screenshot:** The `get_webelement_as_screenshot` method takes a screenshot of the located web element.
9. **Execute Event:** The `execute_event` method handles various events specified in the locator, such as clicks, pauses, uploads, screenshots, clearing fields, sending keys, and typing messages.
10. **Send Message:** The `send_message` method sends a message to a web element using the provided locator and optional typing speed.
11. **Navigate:** The `goto` method navigates the browser to a specified URL.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.webdriver.playwright.executor import PlaywrightExecutor
from src.webdriver.playwright.locators import close_banner

async def example_usage():
    executor = PlaywrightExecutor(browser_type='chromium')
    await executor.start()  # Start the Playwright browser

    # Use the executor to interact with a web element using the close_banner locator
    await executor.execute_locator(close_banner)  # Click the close button

    await executor.stop()  # Stop the browser

asyncio.run(example_usage())  # Run the example usage function
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
