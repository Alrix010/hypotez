**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet defines a Playwright crawler module that allows for browser automation with customized configurations. It loads settings from a JSON configuration file (`playwrid.json`) and creates a Playwright browser instance with the specified options.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import the Playwright module:**
   ```python
   from src.webdriver.playwright import Playwrid
   ```
2. **Initialize the Playwright crawler with optional custom settings:**
   ```python
   browser = Playwrid(options=["--headless"])  # Example with custom headless mode
   ```
3. **Start the browser and navigate to a website:**
   ```python
   browser.start("https://www.example.com") 
   ```

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.webdriver.playwright import Playwrid

# Initialize Playwright crawler with custom options
browser = Playwrid(options=["--headless"])

# Start the browser and navigate to a website
browser.start("https://www.example.com")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
