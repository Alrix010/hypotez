**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Firefox` class is a custom WebDriver for Firefox that extends the standard `selenium.webdriver.Firefox` with additional features like custom profile management, kiosk mode, and proxy settings. It provides a more comprehensive approach to browser automation, offering greater control over the browser environment.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the `Firefox` Class**: Create an instance of the `Firefox` class, passing in desired arguments like the profile name, window mode, and user agent.
2. **Start the Browser**: The constructor initializes the browser with custom settings, including loading options from a configuration file, setting the window mode, and configuring proxy settings if enabled.
3. **Access Browser Features**: The `Firefox` class inherits methods from the standard `selenium.webdriver.Firefox` class, allowing users to interact with the browser, such as navigating to URLs (`get`), interacting with web elements (`find_element`, `find_elements`), and performing actions like clicking and typing.
4. **Utilize Extended Features**: The `Firefox` class extends the standard WebDriver with custom methods like `set_proxy`, which allows users to configure proxy settings for the browser. It also includes methods for retrieving information from the page, such as the page language and the ready state of the browser.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.webdriver.firefox.firefox import Firefox

    # Start Firefox in kiosk mode with a custom profile
    browser = Firefox(profile_name="custom_profile", window_mode="kiosk")

    # Navigate to a website
    browser.get("https://www.example.com")

    # Interact with a web element (for example, click a button)
    button = browser.find_element_by_id("my_button")
    button.click()

    # Close the browser
    browser.quit()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
