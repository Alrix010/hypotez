**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block defines a `Chrome` class that extends the `webdriver.Chrome` class. It allows for custom configuration of a Chrome WebDriver instance with features like profile management, user agent selection, proxy configuration, and window mode customization.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method loads configuration from a JSON file, initializes the WebDriver service, and sets up Chrome options based on configuration and provided parameters.
2. **User Agent**: The `user_agent` is set to a random user agent string.
3. **Proxy**: If enabled in the configuration, the code attempts to find a working proxy from a provided file and sets up the WebDriver to use it.
4. **Profile Directory**: The code configures the user data directory for the Chrome WebDriver, allowing for profile-specific configurations.
5. **WebDriver Initialization**: The code initializes the WebDriver instance using the configured options and service.
6. **Payload**: The code initializes and loads custom functionalities, such as `JavaScript` execution and `ExecuteLocator` capabilities, which extend the WebDriver's functionality.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    driver = Chrome(window_mode='full_window')
    driver.get(r"https://google.com")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
