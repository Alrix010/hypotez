**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines the `BrowserController` class, which manages a web browser (Chrome) using Selenium. It offers methods for navigation, searching, scraping, and interacting with the browser.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `BrowserController` class is initialized with optional settings for headless mode.
2. The `_check_driver` method validates if the browser driver has been initialized successfully.
3. The `search` method performs a search query on the specified search engine. It navigates to the search engine, finds the search box, enters the query, submits it, waits for results to load, and retrieves the text content of the results.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.webdriver.ai_browser.controllers import BrowserController

# Create a browser controller instance
browser = BrowserController()

# Perform a search query
search_results = browser.search(query='Python programming', search_engine_url='https://www.google.com')

# Print the search results
print(search_results)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
