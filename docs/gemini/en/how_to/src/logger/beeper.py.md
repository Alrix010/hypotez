**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the `Beeper` Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Beeper` class provides a way to play different sounds based on the type of event occurring in the system. Each event level (e.g., `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) is associated with a specific melody. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Create a `Beeper` instance**: This initializes the sound system.
2. **Call the `beep()` method**: This triggers the sound playback.
3. **Specify the event level**: This determines which melody to play.
4. **Optional parameters**: You can adjust the `frequency` and `duration` of the sound.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.logger.beeper import Beeper, BeepLevel

# Play an INFO beep
Beeper.beep(BeepLevel.INFO)

# Play a custom beep
Beeper.beep(frequency=800, duration=500)

# Play a WARNING beep for 1 second
Beeper.beep(BeepLevel.WARNING, duration=1000)

# Set silent mode
Beeper.silent = True

# Attempt to play a beep (will be skipped)
Beeper.beep(BeepLevel.ERROR)

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
