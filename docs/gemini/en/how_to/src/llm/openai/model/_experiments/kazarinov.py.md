**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a class `OpenAIChat` that encapsulates communication with an OpenAI chat model (specifically `gpt-3.5-turbo`) and provides methods to send questions and receive responses.  The code also includes a function `chat()` that facilitates a simple interactive chat session with the user.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Load System Instruction**: Loads a system instruction from a file `system_instruction.txt` for providing context to the chat model.
2. **Initialize OpenAI Model**: Creates an instance of the `OpenAIChat` class, setting up the OpenAI API key and optional system instructions.
3. **Send Question**: The `ask()` method takes a user prompt as input, adds it to a list of messages, and sends the entire message history to the OpenAI API using `openai.ChatCompletion.create()`.
4. **Receive Response**: The `ask()` method then processes the API response, extracting the assistant's reply and returning it to the user.
5. **Handle Errors**:  Includes error handling to gracefully handle potential exceptions during API interaction.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.ai.openai.model._experiments.kazarinov import OpenAIChat, chat

# Get OpenAI API key from the user
api_key = input("Enter your OpenAI API key: ")

# Start the chat session
chat(api_key=api_key) 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
