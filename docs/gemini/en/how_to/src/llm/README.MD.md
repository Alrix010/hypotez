**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block adds a reStructuredText directive to a Python file, indicating that the file is a module. It also includes a table of contents with links to related documentation and a brief description of the module's purpose.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `.. module::` directive is used to identify the file as a module in reStructuredText documentation.
2. The `src.ai` string specifies the module name.
3. The table of contents is created using HTML tags (TABLE, TR, TD, A, and HREF). 
4. Links are provided to other relevant documentation files within the project.
5. A brief description of the module's purpose is provided in the text.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
                ```rst

.. module:: src.ai
```
<TABLE >
<TR>
<TD>
<A HREF = 'https://github.com/hypo69/hypotez/blob/master/README.MD'>[Root ↑]</A>
</TD>
<TD>
<A HREF = 'https://github.com/hypo69/hypotez/blob/master/src/README.MD'>src</A> 
</TD>

<TD>
<A HREF = 'https://github.com/hypo69/hypotez/blob/master/src/ai/readme.ru.md'>Русский</A>
</TD>
