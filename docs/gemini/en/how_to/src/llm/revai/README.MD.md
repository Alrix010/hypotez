**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block defines the use of Revai, a service that transcribes audio files like meeting recordings, calls, etc. It includes links to Revai's API documentation and Python code samples. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. This section introduces Revai and its functionality.
2. It provides links to Revai's API documentation and Python code samples, enabling developers to learn more about Revai's capabilities and explore examples of code interaction.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Use Revai to transcribe an audio file
from revai import Client

# Create a Revai client object
client = Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Upload an audio file
with open("audio_file.mp3", "rb") as f:
    audio_data = f.read()
    job_id = client.submit_job(audio_data)

# Get the transcription result
transcription = client.get_transcription(job_id)

# Print the transcription
print(transcription.text)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
