**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a `RevAI` class that interacts with the Rev.ai API for processing audio files. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `RevAI` class is initialized with an API key.
2. **Process Audio File**: The `process_audio_file` method takes an audio file path as input. 
    - It checks if the file exists.
    - It sends a request to the Rev.ai API with the audio file.
    - It receives the response from the API.
    - It parses the response and returns the results as a dictionary. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from src.ai.revai import RevAI

    # ... (Initialize the RevAI object with your API key) ...

    revai_instance = RevAI(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY') 
    result = revai_instance.process_audio_file('path/to/audio.wav')

    # ... (Process the results) ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
