**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a module within the `src.ai.dialogflow` package, indicating its role in the project.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code block initiates a reStructuredText (RST) directive, `.. module::`, signifying that the subsequent lines will define a module. 
2. The module name, `src.ai.dialogflow`, is specified, providing the path to the module within the project.
3. The RST directive is closed with the code block ending tag.
4. The RST directive is closed with the code block ending tag.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.ai.dialogflow import Dialogflow

project_id = "your-project-id"
session_id = "unique-session-id"

dialogflow_client = Dialogflow(project_id, session_id)

# Example usage of methods
intent_response = dialogflow_client.detect_intent("Hello")
print("Detected Intent:", intent_response)

intents = dialogflow_client.list_intents()
print("List of Intents:", intents)

new_intent = dialogflow_client.create_intent(
    display_name="NewIntent",
    training_phrases_parts=["new phrase", "another phrase"],
    message_texts=["This is a new intent"]
)
print("Created Intent:", new_intent)

# Deleting an intent (make sure to replace intent_id with a real ID)
# dialogflow_client.delete_intent("your-intent-id")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
