**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

## How to Use the `src.ai.gemini` Module

### Overview

The `src.ai.gemini` module provides an interface for interacting with Google Generative AI models. The `GoogleGenerativeAi` class in this module offers methods for sending requests, processing responses, managing dialogs, and integrating with various AI functionalities. It includes robust error handling, logging, and configuration settings to ensure smooth operation.

### Main Functions

#### `__init__(self, api_key: str, model_name: Optional[str] = None, generation_config: Optional[Dict] = None, system_instruction: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs)`

**Purpose**: Initializes the `GoogleGenerativeAi` class with necessary configurations.

**Details**:

- Sets the API key, model name, generation configuration, and system instruction.
- Defines paths for logging dialogs and storing history.
- Initializes the Google Generative AI model.

#### `config()`

**Purpose**: Retrieves the configuration from the settings file.

**Details**:

- Reads and parses the configuration file located at `gs.path.src / 'ai' / 'gemini' / 'gemini.json'`.

#### `_start_chat(self)`

**Purpose**: Starts a chat session with the AI model.

**Details**:

- Initializes a chat session with an empty history.

#### `_save_dialogue(self, dialogue: list)`

**Purpose**: Saves the dialog to text and JSON files.

**Details**:

- Appends each message in the dialog to a text file.
- Appends each message in JSON format to a JSON file.

#### `ask(self, q: str, attempts: int = 15) -> Optional[str]`

**Purpose**: Sends a text request to the AI model and receives a response.

**Details**:

- Handles multiple attempts in case of network errors or service unavailability.
- Logs errors and retries attempts with exponential backoff.
- Saves the dialog to history files.

#### `chat(self, q: str) -> str`

**Purpose**: Sends a chat message to the AI model and receives a response.

**Details**:

- Uses the chat session initialized by the `_start_chat` method.
- Logs errors and returns the text response.

#### `describe_image(self, image_path: Path) -> Optional[str]`

**Purpose**: Generates a text description of an image.

**Details**:

- Encodes the image in base64 and sends it to the AI model.
- Returns the generated description or logs an error if the operation fails.

#### `upload_file(self, file: str | Path | IOBase, file_name: Optional[str] = None) -> bool`

**Purpose**: Uploads a file to the AI model.

**Details**:

- Handles file upload and logs success or failure.
- Provides retry logic in case of errors.

### Error Handling

The class includes comprehensive error handling for various scenarios:

- **Network Errors**: Retries with exponential backoff.
- **Service Unavailability**: Logs errors and retries attempts.
- **Quota Limits**: Logs and waits before retrying.
- **Authentication Errors**: Logs and stops further attempts.
- **Invalid Input**: Logs and retries with a timeout.
- **API Errors**: Logs and stops further attempts.

### Logging and History

All interactions with AI models are logged, and dialogs are saved in both text and JSON formats for later analysis. This ensures traceability of all operations and allows review for debugging or auditing purposes.

### Dependencies

- `google.generativeai`
- `requests`
- `grpc`
- `google.api_core.exceptions`
- `google.auth.exceptions`
- `src.logger`
- `src.utils.printer`
- `src.utils.file`
- `src.utils.date_time`
- `src.utils.convertors.unicode`
- `src.utils.jjson`

### Usage Example

```python
ai = GoogleGenerativeAi(api_key="your_api_key", system_instruction="Instruction")
response = ai.ask("How are you?")
print(response)
```

This example initializes the `GoogleGenerativeAi` class and sends a request to the AI model, printing the response.
