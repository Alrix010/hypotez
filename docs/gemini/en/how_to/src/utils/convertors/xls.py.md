**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `xls2dict` function takes a path to an XLS file as input and converts the contents of the XLS file into a Python dictionary. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The function takes an XLS file path (`xls_file`) as input.
2. The function calls the `read_xls_as_dict` function to read the XLS file and convert it to a dictionary.
3. The dictionary is returned from the `xls2dict` function. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from src.utils.convertors.xls import xls2dict
    from pathlib import Path
    xls_file_path = Path('path/to/my_file.xls')
    data = xls2dict(xls_file_path)
    print(data)

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
