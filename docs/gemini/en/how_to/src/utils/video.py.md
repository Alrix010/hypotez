**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block provides functions to download and save video files from a given URL and to retrieve the binary data of a video file. It uses asynchronous functions to handle network requests and file operations efficiently.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **`save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]`**: This function takes a video URL and a local path as input. It then initiates an asynchronous HTTP request to download the video content. 
   - The function checks for HTTP errors during the download.
   - It creates the necessary parent directories for the save path if they don't exist.
   - It writes the downloaded video data to the specified file in chunks to avoid memory overflow.
   - Finally, it performs crucial checks after saving to ensure that the file exists and is not empty. If any error occurs during the download or saving process, it logs the error and returns `None`. 

2. **`get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]`**: This function takes a file path to a video file as input. 
   - It checks if the file exists.
   - If the file exists, it attempts to read the binary data of the video file.
   - If the file is not found or an error occurs while reading the file, it logs the error and returns `None`.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    import asyncio
    url = "https://example.com/video.mp4"  # Replace with a valid URL!
    save_path = "local_video.mp4"
    result = asyncio.run(save_video_from_url(url, save_path))
    if result:
        print(f"Video saved to {result}")
    
    data = get_video_data(save_path)
    if data:
        print(f"Video data: {data[:10]}...") 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
