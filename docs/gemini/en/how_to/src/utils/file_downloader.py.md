**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `download_file` function downloads a file from a specified URL and saves it to a local file on the disk.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The function initiates an HTTP GET request to the provided URL using the `requests` library, enabling the download of the file in a streaming manner.
2. It checks the response status code. If the code is 200 (success), it opens the destination file in binary write mode (`wb`).
3. The file is downloaded in chunks of 1024 bytes to avoid memory issues when handling large files. Each chunk is written to the opened file.
4. Upon successful download, a message is printed to indicate completion.
5. If the response status code is not 200, an error message is printed.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Example URL for a file to download
    file_url = 'https://example.com/path/to/file.txt'
    
    # Desired file name to save on the disk
    save_as = 'downloaded_file.txt'
    
    # Call the download_file function to initiate the download
    download_file(file_url, save_as) 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
