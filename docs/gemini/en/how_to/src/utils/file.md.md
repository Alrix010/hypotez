**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `file.py` module provides a set of functions for working with files and directories, including handling large files using generators and recursive file searching. The functions are well-structured and have clear purposes. Added functionality for handling extra whitespace and escaping quotes enhances functionality. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **`save_text_file(data, file_path, mode='w')`:**  Writes data to the specified text file. Supports writing strings, lists of strings, and dictionaries (dictionaries are serialized to JSON).
2. **`read_text_file_generator(file_path, as_list=False, extensions=None, chunk_size=8192, recursive=False, patterns=None)`:**  Reads the contents of a file or directory, using a generator for efficient handling of large files. Supports recursive file search in directories and filtering by file extensions and name patterns.
3. **`read_text_file(file_path, as_list=False, extensions=None, exc_info=True, chunk_size=8192)`:** Reads the contents of a file or directory. A simpler version than `read_text_file_generator`, not using generators.
4. **`yield_text_from_files(file_path, as_list=False, chunk_size=8192)`:** Reads a file and returns its contents as a generator of strings (`as_list=True`) or as a single string (`as_list=False`). Helper function for `read_text_file_generator`.
5. **`_read_file_content(file_path, chunk_size)`:** Helper function for reading the contents of a file in chunks and returning it as a single string. Used to increase efficiency when working with very large files.
6. **`_read_file_lines_generator(file_path, chunk_size)`:** Helper function for reading a file line by line using a generator. Efficient for large files because it does not load the entire file into memory at once.
7. **`get_filenames_from_directory(directory, ext='*')`:** Returns a list of filenames in the specified directory, optionally filtering by extension.
8. **`recursively_yield_file_path(root_dir, patterns='*')`:** Recursively iterates through files in the specified directory and its subdirectories, returning file paths that match the given patterns.
9. **`recursively_get_file_path(root_dir, patterns='*')`:** Recursively finds all files in the directory and its subdirectories that match the specified patterns and returns a list of their paths.
10. **`recursively_read_text_files(root_dir, patterns, as_list=False)`:** Recursively reads the contents of files in the specified directory, matching the given patterns.
11. **`get_directory_names(directory)`:** Returns a list of subdirectory names in the specified directory.
12. **`remove_bom(path)`:** Removes BOM (Byte Order Mark) from a text file or from all `.py` files in a directory. BOM is an invisible character that can cause problems in some applications.
13. **`main()`:** Entry point for the script that removes BOM from all `.py` files in the `src` directory.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.utils.file import save_text_file, read_text_file, remove_bom

# Example of saving data to a file
data = "This is some text to save."
file_path = "my_file.txt"
save_text_file(data, file_path)

# Example of reading file contents
file_path = "my_file.txt"
content = read_text_file(file_path)
print(content)

# Example of removing BOM from a file or directory
file_path = "my_file.py"
remove_bom(file_path)

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
