**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block provides several functions for working with CSV files. These functions can be used to save a list of dictionaries to a CSV file, read CSV content as a list of dictionaries, convert a CSV file to JSON format, read CSV content as a dictionary, and load CSV data into a list of dictionaries using Pandas. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **`save_csv_file(data: List[Dict[str, str]], file_path: Union[str, Path], mode: str = 'a', exc_info: bool = True) -> bool`**: This function takes a list of dictionaries, a file path, a file mode (append or overwrite), and a flag to include traceback information in logs. It saves the data to the specified CSV file.
2. **`read_csv_file(file_path: Union[str, Path], exc_info: bool = True) -> List[Dict[str, str]] | None`**: This function takes a file path and a flag to include traceback information in logs. It reads the CSV file and returns a list of dictionaries containing the data.
3. **`read_csv_as_json(csv_file_path: Union[str, Path], json_file_path: Union[str, Path], exc_info: bool = True) -> bool`**: This function takes a CSV file path, a JSON file path, and a flag to include traceback information in logs. It converts the CSV file to JSON format and saves it to the specified file path.
4. **`read_csv_as_dict(csv_file: Union[str, Path]) -> dict | None`**: This function takes a CSV file path and converts the CSV content to a dictionary. It returns the dictionary or None if there was an error.
5. **`read_csv_as_ns(file_path: Union[str, Path]) -> List[dict]`**: This function takes a CSV file path and uses Pandas to load the CSV data into a list of dictionaries. It returns the list of dictionaries or an empty list if there was an error.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.utils.csv import save_csv_file, read_csv_file, read_csv_as_json

# Save data to a CSV file
data = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25},
]
save_csv_file(data, 'data.csv')

# Read CSV content as a list of dictionaries
data = read_csv_file('data.csv')
print(data)

# Convert a CSV file to JSON format
read_csv_as_json('data.csv', 'data.json')
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
