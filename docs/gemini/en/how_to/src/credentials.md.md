## How to Use This Code Block

=========================================================================================

### Description

This code block defines a function `set_project_root` which aims to find the root directory of the project. It does this by starting from the current directory of the script and iterating up through its parent directories. The search stops when a directory containing any of the specified `marker_files` is found.

### Execution Steps

1. The function starts by defining a variable `current_path` which holds the path to the current directory of the script.
2. The function initializes a variable `__root__` to the `current_path`.
3. It iterates through a list of directories starting from the `current_path` and going up through its parent directories.
4. For each directory, it checks if any of the `marker_files` exist in that directory. If any of the `marker_files` are found, the `__root__` variable is set to that directory and the loop breaks.
5. If the `__root__` variable is not found in the `sys.path` list, it is added to the beginning of the list. This ensures that the project can import modules from the root directory.
6. Finally, the function returns the `__root__` variable, which holds the path to the root directory of the project.

### Usage Example

```python
from src.credentials import set_project_root

# Find the root directory of the project
root_dir = set_project_root(marker_files=('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git'))

# Print the path to the root directory
print(f"Root directory: {root_dir}")
