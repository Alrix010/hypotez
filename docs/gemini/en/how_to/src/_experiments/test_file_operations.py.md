**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `test_file_operations()` function performs a series of tests on basic file operations like creating, writing, reading, appending, and deleting a file. It ensures that each operation is performed correctly and the expected results are achieved.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Define File Path**: The function starts by defining the name of the file to be used for the tests (`test_file.txt`).
2. **Create and Write to File**: The function creates a new file with the defined name and writes the text "Hello, World!" into it using the `open()` function with the `w` mode (write).
3. **Read File Content**: The function opens the file in read mode (`r`) and reads the content using the `read()` method. It then asserts that the read content matches the expected "Hello, World!" string, ensuring that the file was created and written to correctly.
4. **Append New Content**: The function opens the file in append mode (`a`) and appends the string "\nAppended Line" to the existing content.
5. **Verify Appended Content**: The function reads the entire content of the file into a list of lines (`readlines()`) and asserts that the second line (index 1) contains the appended string "Appended Line".
6. **Delete File**: Finally, the function checks if the file exists and, if so, deletes it using the `os.remove()` function. If the file doesn't exist, it prints a message indicating that it was not found. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Run the test function
    test_file_operations() 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
