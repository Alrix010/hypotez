**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block executes a scenario, which involves retrieving data from a supplier's website and inserting it into PrestaShop. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Load the Scenario:** The code first loads the scenario file, which is a JSON file containing the instructions for the scenario.
2. **Initialize Supplier:** It creates an instance of the supplier class, which provides access to supplier-specific methods for scraping data.
3. **Extract Product Data:** The code extracts product data from the supplier's website, including information about product categories, prices, and descriptions.
4. **Insert Data into PrestaShop:**  It processes the extracted product data and sends it to PrestaShop for insertion.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.scenario.scenario_executor import run_scenario_file

# Load the scenario file
scenario_file = Path("./my_scenario.json")

# Create a supplier instance (example with a placeholder supplier class)
class MySupplier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.supplier_prefix = "my_supplier"
        self.related_modules = None  # Placeholder for related modules
        self.driver = None  # Placeholder for driver
        self.scenario_files = [scenario_file]

# Run the scenario
run_scenario_file(MySupplier(), scenario_file)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
