**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the Graber Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Graber` class is responsible for collecting data fields from product pages on `morlevi.co.il`. It inherits from the `Graber` parent class, overriding functions for custom field handling. It also features a decorator that allows for pre-processing actions before sending requests to the web driver.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the Graber Class**: The `Graber` class is initialized with optional arguments like a web driver instance (`driver`) and a language index (`lang_index`). 
2. **Configure the Web Driver**:  The `Config` class is updated with the web driver instance and the `close_pop_up` locator for use in the decorator.
3. **Override Functions for Custom Field Handling**:  The `Graber` class can override functions for custom field processing based on the specific needs of `morlevi.co.il` product pages.
4. **Decorator for Pre-Processing Actions**: The decorator can be used to perform actions before sending requests to the web driver. The `Context.locator` field is used to specify the element to be processed by the decorator.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.morlevi.graber import Graber

# Initialize the Graber class
graber = Graber(driver=driver)  # Assuming `driver` is a web driver instance

# Access data fields using the overridden methods
product_name = graber.get_product_name()
product_price = graber.get_product_price()
# ... other data fields ...

# Apply the decorator to a specific locator
@graber.decorator
def get_product_image(self):
    # ... logic to process the image ...
    return image_data

# Access the decorated function
image_data = graber.get_product_image()

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
