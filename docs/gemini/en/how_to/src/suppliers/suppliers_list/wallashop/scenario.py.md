**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code snippet defines three functions:
    - `get_list_products_in_category`: retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page.
    - `paginator`: handles pagination on the category page.
    - `get_list_categories_from_site`: collects a list of current categories from the website.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **`get_list_products_in_category`**:
    - Initializes the `driver` and `locator` objects from the `Supplier` object.
    - Waits for 1 second.
    - Executes the `close_banner` locator to close any banner pop-ups.
    - Scrolls the page down.
    - Executes the `product_links` locator to retrieve product URLs from the category page.
    - If no links are found, a warning is logged and the function returns None.
    - The code iterates through the pagination links, using the `paginator` function to handle pagination.
    - The `list_products_in_category` is appended with new product URLs retrieved from each page.
    - The function returns a list of product URLs found in the category.

2. **`paginator`**:
    - Executes the `pagination` locator to find the pagination element.
    - If no pagination element is found, the function returns None.
    - The function returns True if the pagination element is found.

3. **`get_list_categories_from_site`**:
    - This function is not fully defined in the provided code snippet. It is likely responsible for collecting the current categories from the website, possibly by scraping the website's navigation structure or using a specific API.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle.scenario import get_list_products_in_category

# Initialize a Supplier object
supplier = Supplier(...)

# Get the list of product URLs from a specific category
product_urls = get_list_products_in_category(supplier)

# Process the list of product URLs
for url in product_urls:
    # Perform actions for each product URL
    print(f"Processing product: {url}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
