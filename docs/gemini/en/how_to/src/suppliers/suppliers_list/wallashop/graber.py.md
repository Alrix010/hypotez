**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Graber` class, extending the `Grbr` class, is designed to gather data from the `wallashop.co.il` product page. It inherits functions for handling each field from the parent class but allows for overriding those functions to handle specific fields. This class also utilizes a decorator for executing actions before sending a request to the WebDriver, which allows for custom pre-processing logic.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `Graber` class is initialized with a `driver` instance (presumably a WebDriver) and `lang_index` (the index of the language for which the data should be retrieved).
2. The `supplier_prefix` is set to 'wallashop'.
3. The `__init__` method of the parent class, `Grbr`, is called to initialize the base functionality.
4. The `Config.locator_for_decorator` is set to `None`. This variable controls whether the default decorator will be applied or not. If a specific value is provided, it will be used in the `@close_pop_up` decorator.


Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.wallashop.graber import Graber
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver

# Initialize the WebDriver
driver = Driver(Firefox) 

# Initialize the Graber class with the WebDriver and language index
graber = Graber(driver, 0)  # 0 is the index of the language

# Access the graber instance and use its methods to retrieve data from the product page
# ...

# Example: Retrieve product name
product_name = graber.get_product_name()

# Example: Retrieve product price
product_price = graber.get_product_price()

# Example: Execute a custom decorator
graber.Config.locator_for_decorator = "custom_locator"  # Set the locator for the decorator
# ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
