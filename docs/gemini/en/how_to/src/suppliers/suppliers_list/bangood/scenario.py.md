**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page on the Bangood website using a web driver. It handles banner closures, scrolling, and data extraction. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize Driver**: The code starts by accessing the web driver associated with the supplier (`s.driver`).
2. **Close Banner**: The code executes the locator `s.locators['product']['close_banner']` to close any pop-up banners on the page.
3. **Locate Category Elements**: The code retrieves the locators for the category page (`s.locators['category']`) and verifies their existence.
4. **Scroll Page**: The code scrolls the page to ensure all elements are loaded.
5. **Retrieve Product Links**: The code executes the locator `l['product_links']` to extract a list of product URLs from the page.
6. **Handle Single Product Link**: If only one product link is found, the code converts it into a list for consistency.
7. **Log Results**: The code logs the number of product URLs found.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.bangood.scenario import get_list_products_in_category

# Assuming 'supplier' is an instance of a Bangood Supplier class
product_urls = get_list_products_in_category(supplier)

# Print the list of product URLs
print(product_urls)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
