**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code snippet defines a class called `Graber` which inherits from the `Graber` base class and is used to collect product data from the Bangood website. It provides methods for processing different product fields on the page. If a custom field processing is required, the method can be overridden.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `Graber` class is initialized with a `Driver` object and a language index. The `supplier_prefix` is set to `'bangood'`.
2. **Setting Global Configuration**: Global settings are set using the `Config` class. The `locator_for_decorator` attribute is set to `None` by default, which indicates that no specific locator will be used in the `@close_pop_up` decorator.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.bangood.graber import Graber
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver

# Initialize the driver
driver = Driver(Chrome)  # Replace with your desired browser

# Create an instance of the Graber class
graber = Graber(driver, 0)  # 0 represents the language index

# You can now use the graber object to collect product data
# ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
