**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a function `get_list_products_in_category()` that retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page on Banggood.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The function takes an instance of `Supplier` (representing a supplier) as an argument.
2. It obtains the WebDriver (`d`) from the supplier object.
3. It attempts to close any banners on the page using `d.execute_locator(s.locators['product']['close_banner'])`.
4. It accesses the category locator from the supplier's locator dictionary.
5. It checks if the category locator exists and logs an error message if it doesn't.
6. It scrolls the page using `d.scroll()`.
7. It retrieves product links from the category page using `d.execute_locator(l['product_links'])`.
8. It checks if there are any product links found and logs a warning message if none are found.
9. It formats the product links into a list and logs the number of products found.
10. Finally, it returns the list of product URLs.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.bangood import Scenario
from src.suppliers import Supplier

# Create a Banggood supplier instance
supplier = Supplier("bangood.co.il", "Banggood", "Banggood")
scenario = Scenario(supplier)

# Get product URLs from a category page
product_urls = scenario.get_list_products_in_category(supplier)

# Print the list of product URLs
if product_urls:
    print(product_urls)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
