**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `get_list_products_in_category` function fetches a list of product URLs from a category page on a website. It handles pagination and provides logging information about the number of products found. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. Initializes a `Driver` object from the `Supplier` object.
2. Executes the `close_banner` locator from the `Supplier` object's locators to close any banner elements on the page.
3. Scrolls the page to ensure all product links are visible.
4. Extracts a list of product links using the `product_links` locator from the `category` locator dictionary.
5. Logs a warning if no product links are found.
6. Iterates through the product links, checks if pagination is required, and appends the product links to a list.
7. Logs the number of products found in the category.
8. Returns a list of product URLs.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle.scenario import get_list_products_in_category

# Initialize a Supplier object
supplier = Supplier(...)

# Get the list of product URLs from the category page
products = get_list_products_in_category(supplier)

# Print the list of product URLs
print(products)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
