**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a class named `Graber` which inherits from the `Grbr` class (presumably, a base class for grabbing data from suppliers). The `Graber` class is specifically designed for retrieving data from Walmart. It initializes the `supplier_prefix` with "wallmart" and utilizes the `Driver` instance passed during initialization to access and interact with the Walmart website.

The class uses the `Config` object to set global configuration settings. Notably, the `locator_for_decorator` attribute in `Config` is used to define a locator for a specific element that might be used in a decorator. This decorator, likely intended for closing pop-ups, is commented out and replaced with a placeholder.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the `Graber` class**:
   - The `Graber` class is initialized with a `Driver` instance and a `lang_index` (presumably representing the language used for data retrieval).
   - The `supplier_prefix` is set to "wallmart".
   - The `Config.locator_for_decorator` is set to `None`, indicating that no specific locator is currently defined for the decorator.

2. **Implement custom data extraction methods**:
   - The `Graber` class might override methods inherited from `Grbr`, enabling customized data retrieval for specific fields on Walmart product pages.

3. **Utilize the decorator**:
   - The decorator, if enabled, will be executed before each data extraction method call.
   - The `Config.locator_for_decorator` will be used to target the appropriate element on the page for decorator actions.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.wallmart.graber import Graber
    from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
    from src.webdriver.browsers import Firefox

    # Initialize the Driver
    driver = Driver(Firefox)

    # Create an instance of the Graber class
    graber = Graber(driver, lang_index=0)

    # Access the extracted data
    product_data = graber.extract_data(product_url) 

    # Perform operations with the product data
    print(product_data) 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
