**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block defines a class called `Graber` that inherits from the `Graber` class in the `src.suppliers.graber` module. This class is used to collect data about products from the Grandadvance website. It provides methods for handling various product fields and allows for customization of field processing.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `Graber` class is initialized with a `Driver` object, which is used to interact with the web browser, and a `lang_index` integer, which specifies the language index.
2. The class loads configuration data from a JSON file using `j_loads_ns` and sets up a `locator` object.
3. The class inherits from the `Graber` class, which defines various methods for handling product fields.
4. The class overrides the `click_to_specifications` method, which is used to click on the "Specifications" button on the product page.
5. The class implements a decorator, which is used to perform pre-processing steps before sending a request to the webdriver.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.grandadvance.graber import Graber
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver

# Initialize the driver
driver = Driver(Chrome)

# Create an instance of the Graber class
graber = Graber(driver, lang_index=0)

# Access and use the methods of the Graber class
graber.click_to_specifications()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
