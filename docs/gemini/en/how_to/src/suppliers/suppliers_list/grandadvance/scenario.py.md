**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet defines two functions: `get_list_products_in_category` and `get_list_categories_from_site`. 

`get_list_products_in_category` fetches a list of product URLs from a category page on a specific supplier's website using a web driver. 
It handles different scenarios based on the availability of locators, and returns a list of product URLs, or `None` if no products are found.

`get_list_categories_from_site` is intended to retrieve a list of categories from the supplier's website, but its implementation is not provided in this snippet.


Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **`get_list_products_in_category(s)` Function**
    - Takes a `Supplier` object `s` as input.
    - Retrieves the web driver (`d`) from the `s` object.
    - Gets the locators for the category page from the `s` object's `locators` dictionary.
    - Executes the `close_banner` locator to close any pop-up banners on the page.
    - Checks if the locators for the category page are available and logs an error if not found.
    - Scrolling the page (though the code doesn't contain the implementation of the scrolling logic).
    - Executes the `product_links` locator to fetch the URLs of the products within the category.
    - Logs a warning message if no product links are found.
    - Returns a list of product URLs.

2. **`get_list_categories_from_site(s)` Function**
    - The implementation of this function is not included in the snippet. It likely retrieves a list of categories from the supplier's website.


Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.bangood.scenario import get_list_products_in_category
from src.suppliers.suppliers import Supplier

# Create a Supplier object
supplier = Supplier('bangood', 'https://www.bangood.com')

# Get the list of products in a specific category
products_urls = get_list_products_in_category(supplier)

# Print the list of product URLs
if products_urls:
    print("Found product URLs:", products_urls)
else:
    print("No products found.")
```


4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
