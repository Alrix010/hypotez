**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Graber` class is used to gather data about products from Ebay. It inherits from the base `Graber` class in `src.suppliers.graber`.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `Graber` class is initialized, setting the `supplier_prefix` to "ebay" and calling the parent class's initializer.
2. Global settings are established through the `Config` class.
3. The code includes a commented-out decorator template for potentially adding custom logic to close pop-up windows before executing the main function.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.ebay.graber import Graber
from src.webdirver import Driver, Firefox

driver = Driver(Firefox)
graber = Graber(driver=driver) 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
