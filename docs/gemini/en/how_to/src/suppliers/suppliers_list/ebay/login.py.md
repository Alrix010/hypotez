**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a module for eBay login functionality, likely using a web driver. It appears to be a basic structure for a module with a placeholder for authentication logic.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. This code block imports necessary modules.
2. It defines a docstring for the module, describing its purpose and platform compatibility.
3. It has placeholders for further module documentation, likely for specific functions or classes related to login.
4. It includes a placeholder for an image illustrating the login process, indicated by the `@image` directive.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.ebay.login import EbayLogin

# Instantiate the login class
ebay_login = EbayLogin()

# Call the login method with appropriate credentials
login_success = ebay_login.login("username", "password")

# Check if login was successful
if login_success:
    # Proceed with other operations
    print("Login successful.")
else:
    print("Login failed.")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
