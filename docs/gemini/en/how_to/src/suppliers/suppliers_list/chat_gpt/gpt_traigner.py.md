**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block defines the `GPT_Traigner` class which is used to collect and process conversations from ChatGPT. 

It includes methods to:
- `dump_downloaded_conversations()`: Collects conversation data from HTML files located in the 'chat_gpt/conversation' folder in Google Drive.
- `save_conversations_to_jsonl()`: Saves conversation pairs to a JSONL file.
- `determine_sentiment()`: Determines the sentiment of a conversation pair.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `dump_downloaded_conversations()` method first retrieves the list of HTML files in the `chat_gpt/conversation` folder.
2. It then iterates through each file and uses the `driver.execute_locator()` method to extract user and assistant conversation elements from the HTML.
3. The extracted text from the user and assistant is then processed and stored in a dictionary, which is appended to the `all_data` list.
4. The `all_data` list is then used to create a Pandas DataFrame, which is saved to a CSV and a JSONL file.
5. The raw conversations are also saved to a separate text file.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.chat_gpt.gpt_traigner import GPT_Traigner

# Create an instance of the GPT_Traigner class
traigner = GPT_Traigner()

# Dump the downloaded conversations
traigner.dump_downloaded_conversations()

# Use the collected conversations with the Model class 
model = Model()
model.stream_w(data_file_path=Path(gs.path.google_drive / 'chat_gpt' / 'conversation' / 'all_conversations.csv'))
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
