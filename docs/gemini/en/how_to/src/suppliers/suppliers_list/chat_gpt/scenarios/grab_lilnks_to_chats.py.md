**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a function `get_links` which retrieves links to individual chats from a chat list page. The function uses a web driver (Chrome or Firefox) to navigate to the chat list page and then extracts links based on a predefined locator specified in a JSON file.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `get_links` function takes a `Driver` object as input.
2. The function uses the `execute_locator` method of the driver to retrieve the links based on the `locator.link` defined in the JSON file.
3. The retrieved links are returned as a list.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src import gs
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
from src.webdriver.firefox import Firefox

# Load the chat list locator from JSON
locator = j_loads_ns(gs.path.src / 'suppliers' / 'chat_gpt' / 'locators' / 'chats_list.json')

# Create a Firefox driver instance
d = Driver(Firefox)

# Navigate to the chat list page
d.get_url('https://chatgpt.com/')

# Get the links to individual chats
links = get_links(d)

# ... further processing of the links 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
