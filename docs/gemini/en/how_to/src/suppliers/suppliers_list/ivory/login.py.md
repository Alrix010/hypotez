**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a module for interacting with the Ivory supplier. It includes basic information like platform compatibility and synopsis, but it doesn't contain any actual code yet.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. This code block imports the `src.suppliers.ivory` module.
2. It defines a docstring for the module that indicates the platform and its synopsis.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.ivory import *  # Import the module

# Use functions from the module to interact with Ivory
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
