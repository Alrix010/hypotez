**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet defines a class called `Supplier` and uses it to scrape product data from a specific online store. The class defines various methods to extract data from different fields of the product, including its name, description, price, and other attributes. It also uses the `Driver` class to control the web browser and execute Selenium locators.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code begins by importing necessary libraries, such as `os`, `sys`, `pathlib`, `typing`, `selenium.webdriver.remote.webelement`, `src.webdriver.executor`, and `src.product.Product`.
2. It then sets up the root directory and adds it to the `sys.path` to allow importing modules from different parts of the project.
3. An instance of the `Supplier` class is created, along with instances of `Product` and `ProductFields` classes.
4. The script sets up a dictionary `s.current_scenario` containing information about the product category and other details.
5. The `grab_product_page` function is defined, which is responsible for scraping data from the product page and populating the `ProductFields` object.
6. Inside the `grab_product_page` function, a series of functions are defined, each responsible for extracting data from a specific field. For example, `product_reference_and_volume_and_price_for_100` extracts the product's reference, volume, and price.
7. Each field function executes Selenium locators using the `d.execute_locator` method to retrieve data from the product page.
8. After extracting all data, the `ProductFields` object is returned, which contains the scraped data in a structured format.
9. Finally, the code calls the `grab_product_page` function to scrape the product data and then updates or adds the product to the PrestaShop database using the `Product` class methods.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Create an instance of the Supplier class
    s: Supplier = Supplier(supplier_prefix='hb')

    # Get the product data from the product page
    product_fields = grab_product_page(s)

    # Access the scraped data in the product_fields object
    print(product_fields.presta_fields_dict)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
