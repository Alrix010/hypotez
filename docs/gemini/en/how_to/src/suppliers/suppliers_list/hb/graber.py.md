**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a `Graber` class, which extends the `Graber` class from the `src.suppliers.graber` module. This class is used to gather specific data from the `hb.co.il` product page. 

It utilizes the `Driver` class from the `src.webdriver.driver` module and the `logger` from the `src.logger.logger` module for interaction with the web page and logging, respectively.

The class includes a method for setting a default image URL, a method for setting a default price, and a commented out method for retrieving a short description. This class is designed to override the default `Graber` behavior for certain fields, as the `Graber` parent class provides default implementations for handling product fields.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `Graber` class is initialized with a driver and an optional language index.
2. The `supplier_prefix` is set to "hb".
3. The class overrides the `default_image_url` and `price` methods, providing default values for these fields.
4. The `description_short` method is commented out, but it would retrieve and set the short description if uncommented.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.hb.graber import Graber
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver

# Initialize a Driver
driver = Driver(Chrome)  # Replace Chrome with your desired browser

# Create a Graber instance
graber = Graber(driver=driver)

# Access fields
graber.fields.price  # Access the price field (set to 150.00 in the Graber class)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
