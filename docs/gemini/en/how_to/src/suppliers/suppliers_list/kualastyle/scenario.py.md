**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines two functions: `get_list_products_in_category` and `paginator`. 

`get_list_products_in_category` retrieves a list of product URLs from a given category page. 
`paginator` implements pagination logic for retrieving product URLs from subsequent pages within a category. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **`get_list_products_in_category` Function**:
    - Initializes a `Driver` object (`d`) and a `locators` dictionary (`l`) from the `Supplier` object (`s`).
    - Waits for 1 second.
    - Executes the `close_banner` locator from the `locators` dictionary to close any pop-up banners.
    - Scrolls to the bottom of the page.
    - Executes the `product_links` locator to get a list of product URLs.
    - If no product URLs are found, logs a warning message and returns `None`.
    - Loops through the pages while the current URL is different from the previous URL:
        - If `paginator` returns `True`, appends new product URLs found on the next page to the `list_products_in_category`.
        - If `paginator` returns `False`, breaks out of the loop.
    - Logs a message indicating the number of items found in the category and returns the list of product URLs.

2. **`paginator` Function**:
    - Executes the `pagination` locator with the '<-' selector to find the previous page link.
    - If the previous page link is not found or the list of elements is empty, logs a message and returns `False`.
    - Otherwise, returns `True`.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle.scenario import get_list_products_in_category

    # Assuming 's' is an instance of the 'Supplier' class
    products_urls = get_list_products_in_category(s)

    # Check if any product URLs were found
    if products_urls:
        # Process the list of product URLs
        for url in products_urls:
            # ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
