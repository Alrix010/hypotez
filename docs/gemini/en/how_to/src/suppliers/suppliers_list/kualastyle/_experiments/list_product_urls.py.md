**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a list named `product_urls` containing URLs of various products from the `kualastyle.com` website. These URLs are associated with a collection of "Sofas" (`%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA`) on the website. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code block initializes a list named `product_urls`.
2. It assigns a series of URLs to the `product_urls` list. Each URL points to a specific product within the "Sofas" collection on `kualastyle.com`.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Access the list of product URLs
    for url in product_urls:
        print(url)

    # Print the first product URL
    print(product_urls[0]) 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
