**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code snippet defines a class named `Graber` that inherits from the `Graber` class in the `src.suppliers.graber` module. It's responsible for scraping data from the `kualastyle.co.il` website, specifically for product pages. The class uses the `Driver` from the `src.webdriver` module to interact with the website and has a specific `supplier_prefix` for `kualastyle`. The `Graber` class utilizes a decorator, `close_pop_up`, which is used to close pop-up windows before executing the main logic of the functions.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Class Initialization**: The `__init__` method of the `Graber` class is called. It sets the `supplier_prefix` to "kualastyle" and calls the parent class's `__init__` method to initialize the base Graber class. It also sets a `Config.locator_for_decorator`, which determines the locator to be executed by the decorator if it's not `None`.
2. **Decorator (`close_pop_up`)**: The `close_pop_up` decorator (commented out in this example) is intended to close pop-up windows before executing functions. If a value is assigned to `Config.locator_for_decorator`, the decorator will use that locator to interact with the website and attempt to close the pop-up window.
3. **Function Overriding**: The class can override methods inherited from the parent class, allowing for customized data scraping logic for `kualastyle` products.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Initialize the Graber class with a Driver instance and language index
driver = Driver(Chrome)  # Instantiate a Chrome driver
graber = Graber(driver, lang_index=0)  # Initialize the Graber class

# Example usage:
graber.get_product_name()  # Scrapes the product name from the page
graber.get_product_price()  # Scrapes the product price from the page
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
