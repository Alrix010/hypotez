**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `login` function handles the login process for the Kualastyle supplier. It first checks if the pop-up needs to be closed, and then attempts to log in. The `close_pop_up` function closes the pop-up window on the Kualastyle website before the login process.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Close Pop-up**: The `close_pop_up` function retrieves the `close_pop_up_locator` from the supplier's locator dictionary, navigates to the Kualastyle website, and waits for the page to load. It then attempts to execute the `close_pop_up_locator` to close the pop-up window. If the pop-up is not found or cannot be closed, a warning message is logged.
2. **Login**: The `login` function calls the `close_pop_up` function to handle any pop-up windows. Currently, it simply returns `True`, indicating a successful login, as the actual login logic is not implemented in this snippet.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Example:
    from src.suppliers.kualastyle.login import login
    from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle import Kualastyle
    
    kualastyle = Kualastyle()
    login(kualastyle)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
