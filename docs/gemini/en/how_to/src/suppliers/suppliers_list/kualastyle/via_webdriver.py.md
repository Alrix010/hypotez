**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page on a specific supplier's website. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page on a specific supplier's website.
2. It initializes a webdriver instance.
3. It retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page on a specific supplier's website.
4. It retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page on a specific supplier's website.
5. It scrolls the page down to load all product URLs.
6. It uses the `execute_locator` method to retrieve the list of product URLs based on specified locators.
7. It returns a list of product URLs.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from src.suppliers.kualastyle.via_webdriver import get_list_products_in_category
    from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle.kualastyle import Kualastyle
    
    kualastyle = Kualastyle()
    products = get_list_products_in_category(kualastyle)
    
    print(products) # This will print a list of product URLs
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
