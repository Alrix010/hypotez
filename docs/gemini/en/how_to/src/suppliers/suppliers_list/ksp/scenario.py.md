**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page of a supplier's website. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize Driver and Locators**:
   - Retrieves the driver object (`d`) and the category locators (`l`) from the supplier object (`s`).
2. **Wait and Close Banner**:
   - Waits for a short duration (1 second) before executing the locator to close any banner elements on the page.
   - This ensures that the banner elements don't interfere with subsequent actions.
3. **Scroll Page**:
   - Executes the `scroll()` method to ensure all product links are visible within the current viewport.
4. **Retrieve Product Links**:
   - Executes the locator to retrieve product links (`l['product_links']`) from the category page.
   - This retrieves all visible product links at this stage.
5. **Handle Empty Product List**:
   - Checks if any product links were found.
   - If no product links are found, logs a warning message and returns `None`.
6. **Paginate through Pages**:
   - Enters a loop to handle pagination on the category page.
   - Checks if the current URL is different from the previous URL. This indicates that the page has changed due to pagination.
7. **Execute Paginator**:
   - Calls the `paginator` function with the driver (`d`), category locators (`l`), and the current list of products (`list_products_in_category`) as arguments.
   - The `paginator` function checks if the next page element exists and attempts to navigate to it.
8. **Append New Product Links**:
   - If the paginator function returns `True`, it indicates that the page has been paginated to the next page.
   - The code appends the newly retrieved product links to the existing list (`list_products_in_category`).
   - If the paginator function returns `False`, the loop breaks, indicating that there are no more pages to paginate.
9. **Log Results**:
   - After the loop, the code logs a debug message indicating the total number of product links found in the category.
   - The function then returns the final list of product URLs.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.ksp.scenario import get_list_products_in_category
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.ksp.supplier import Supplier

# Assuming you have a Supplier object named `supplier`
products = get_list_products_in_category(supplier)

# Check if products were found
if products:
    # Process the list of product URLs
    print(f"Found {len(products)} products in category {supplier.current_scenario['name']}")
    for product_url in products:
        print(f"Product URL: {product_url}")
else:
    print(f"No products found in category {supplier.current_scenario['name']}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
