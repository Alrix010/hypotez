**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code defines a function `get_banners` within the `src.suppliers.ksp` module. This function is responsible for retrieving banners from a specific source, presumably from the KSP platform.  Currently, the function is a placeholder and simply returns `True`.  

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The function `get_banners` is defined.
2. It currently returns `True`, indicating a successful retrieval.
3. The code includes comments with module information and author details.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from src.suppliers.ksp.banners_grabber import get_banners

    # Call the function to retrieve banners
    banners = get_banners()

    # Placeholder for processing the retrieved banners
    if banners:
        print("Banners retrieved successfully.")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
