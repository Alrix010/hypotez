**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code defines a `Graber` class which inherits from the `Grbr` class. The `Graber` class handles data extraction from product pages on the `visualdg.co.il` website. It provides specific implementations for field processing functions inherited from the parent class, allowing for custom data retrieval. The class also utilizes a decorator (`close_pop_up`) to perform pre-processing actions before interacting with the web driver, aiming to address pop-up windows that might interfere with the data extraction process.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `Graber` class initializes with the `supplier_prefix` set to "visualdg" and inherits from the parent `Grbr` class. It sets up global configurations, including the `locator_for_decorator`, which determines whether the `close_pop_up` decorator should be executed.
2. **Decorator Handling**: The `close_pop_up` decorator aims to close pop-up windows before executing the main logic of the functions. It's implemented as a template, and you can uncomment the relevant sections and redefine its behavior to customize its functionality.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.visualdg.graber import Graber

# Initialize the Graber class with a web driver
driver = Driver(Firefox)  # Example using Firefox driver
graber = Graber(driver=driver)

# Example usage: Assuming 'get_product_name' is a method defined in the Graber class
product_name = graber.get_product_name()  # Retrieve the product name from the page
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
