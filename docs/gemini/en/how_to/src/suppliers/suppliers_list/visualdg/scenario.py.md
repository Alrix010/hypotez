**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `get_list_products_in_category()` function retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page. It uses the `Driver` object from the `webdriver` module to interact with the web page. The function handles pagination, ensures the presence of products, and logs the number of products found.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. Initializes a `Driver` object `d` and a `locator` dictionary from the `Supplier` object `s`.
2. Executes the `close_banner` locator to close any pop-up banners on the page.
3. Scrolls the page using the `scroll()` method of the `Driver` object.
4. Executes the `product_links` locator to get a list of product URLs.
5. If no products are found, logs a warning message and returns `None`.
6. If products are found, the function iterates through the pages of the category using the `paginator()` function.
7. For each page, it retrieves the product URLs using the `product_links` locator.
8. The function then combines the product URLs from all pages into a single list.
9. Finally, it logs the number of products found and returns the list of product URLs.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle.scenario import get_list_products_in_category
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle.supplier import Supplier

supplier = Supplier()
products = get_list_products_in_category(supplier)

if products:
    # Process the list of products
    print(f"Found {len(products)} products.")
    for product in products:
        # Do something with the product URL, like grabbing product details
        print(product)
else:
    print("No products found.")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
