**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page on a supplier's website using a web driver. It handles cases where the page requires scrolling and ensures the code works across different use cases.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize**: 
    - The function takes a `Supplier` object as input.
    - It retrieves the web driver from the `Supplier` object.
    - It accesses the category locators from the `Supplier` object.
2. **Close Banner**:
    - The function checks for a close banner locator (`product['close_banner']`) and closes it if found. 
3. **Scroll**:
    - The function scrolls the page to ensure all products are visible.
4. **Retrieve Product URLs**:
    - The function uses the `execute_locator` method of the web driver to retrieve a list of product URLs based on the `category['product_links']` locator.
5. **Handle Empty Results**:
    - If no product URLs are found, the function logs a warning and returns `None`.
6. **Format Results**:
    - If only a single product URL is found, it is converted to a list. Otherwise, the existing list is used.
7. **Log Results**:
    - The function logs the number of products found.
8. **Return Results**:
    - The function returns the list of product URLs.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.bangood import Supplier

# Initialize a Supplier object 
supplier = Supplier()

# Get a list of product URLs for a specific category
product_urls = get_list_products_in_category(supplier)

# Process the list of product URLs
if product_urls:
    for url in product_urls:
        # Perform actions for each product URL (e.g., scrape product details)
        print(f"Processing product: {url}") 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
