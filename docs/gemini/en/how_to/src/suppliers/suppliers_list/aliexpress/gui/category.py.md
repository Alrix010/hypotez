**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines the `CategoryEditor` class which is responsible for providing a user interface for preparing advertising campaigns based on categories within a specific AliExpress campaign.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `CategoryEditor` class inherits from `QtWidgets.QWidget` to create a basic window.
2. The `__init__` method initializes the window with basic UI elements like a "Open JSON File" button, a label to display the selected file name, and buttons to prepare all categories or a specific category.
3. `setup_ui` method sets up the layout of the window by arranging these UI elements.
4. `setup_connections` method sets up signal-slot connections for the UI elements, but in this case it's left empty as there are no specific connections defined in this snippet.
5. `open_file` method opens a file dialog to select a JSON file containing the campaign data.
6. `load_file` method reads the selected JSON file using `j_loads_ns`, stores the data in `self.data`, updates the file name label, and initializes the `AliCampaignEditor` instance for further processing.
7. `create_widgets` method dynamically creates additional UI elements based on the loaded campaign data, displaying information like title, campaign name, and individual categories.
8. `prepare_all_categories_async` and `prepare_category_async` methods, both asynchronous, are responsible for preparing all categories or a specific category using the `AliCampaignEditor` instance.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Assuming you have a valid path to a JSON file containing campaign data
campaign_file_path = "path/to/campaign_data.json" 

# Create an instance of CategoryEditor
category_editor = CategoryEditor()

# Open the JSON file
category_editor.load_file(campaign_file_path)

# Prepare all categories asynchronously
asyncio.run(category_editor.prepare_all_categories_async())

# Alternatively, prepare a specific category asynchronously
asyncio.run(category_editor.prepare_category_async())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
