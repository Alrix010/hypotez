**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block implements the main window interface for managing advertising campaigns. It provides tabs for editing JSON files, managing campaigns, and editing products. It also includes a menu bar with options for file operations (opening, saving, exiting), and editing commands (copy, paste).

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**:
   - The code initializes the main application window with a `QMainWindow`.
   - It creates a `QTabWidget` to hold multiple tabs.
   - It sets the initial geometry (size and position) of the main window.
2. **Tab Creation**:
   - Three tabs are created: "JSON Editor," "Campaign Editor," and "Product Editor."
   - Each tab is associated with a specific editor class (`CampaignEditor`, `CategoryEditor`, and `ProductEditor`).
   - These editor classes likely provide functionalities for handling the specific data associated with each tab.
3. **Menu Bar Creation**:
   - A menu bar is created with "File" and "Edit" menus.
   - "File" menu includes actions for opening a file, saving a file, and exiting the application.
   - "Edit" menu includes actions for copying and pasting text.
4. **File Operations**:
   - The `open_file` method opens a file dialog to select and load a JSON file.
   - The `save_file` method saves the current file based on the active tab.
   - The `exit_application` method closes the main window.
5. **Editing Commands**:
   - The `copy` and `paste` methods handle copying and pasting text from the clipboard, ensuring they work on specific text widgets.
6. **File Loading**:
   - The `load_file` method loads the selected JSON file into the corresponding editor, handling potential exceptions.
7. **Main Function**:
   - The `main` function initializes the application with a `QApplication` and creates an event loop for asynchronous operations using `QEventLoop` and `asyncio`.
   - It instantiates the `MainApp` and shows it.
   - The event loop is run with `loop.run_forever()`, keeping the application active until the user quits.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.aliexpress.gui.main import MainApp

# Create a MainApp instance
app = MainApp()

# Show the main window
app.show()

# Start the event loop (this should typically be done in the main function)
app.exec()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
