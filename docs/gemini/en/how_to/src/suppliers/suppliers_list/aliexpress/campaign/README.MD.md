1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `campaign` module manages the creation and publication of Facebook advertising campaigns.  It involves steps like initializing campaign settings, creating directories, collecting product data, generating promotional materials, reviewing the campaign, and finally publishing it on Facebook.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Start**: The process begins with initiating the creation of a Facebook advertising campaign.
2. **Initialize Campaign Details**: Define the campaign name, language, and currency. For example: Campaign Name: "Summer Sale," Language: "English," Currency: "USD."
3. **Create Campaign and Category Directories**: Establish necessary directories or files for the campaign. This may involve creating a folder structure on the file system to hold campaign assets.
4. **Save Campaign Configuration**: Store the initialized campaign details. This could involve writing data to a database or configuration file.
5. **Collect Product Data**: Gather data related to the products to be promoted within the campaign. Examples include product IDs, descriptions, images, and prices fetched from an inventory system.
6. **Save Product Data**: Store the collected product data. This might involve writing data to a database table dedicated to campaign products.
7. **Create Promotional Materials**: Generate or select graphics, banners, and other promotional assets. Examples include images and descriptions tailored to attract customers.
8. **Review Campaign**: Conduct a review process to confirm that all campaign components are ready. This may involve a human or system review to assess the quality and completeness of all campaign elements.
9. **Is Campaign Ready?**: Check if the campaign is complete and ready for publishing. A boolean flag might signal "Yes" if everything is in place, otherwise "No," triggering a loop back to a previous step for corrections.
10. **Publish Campaign**: Make the campaign live on the platform, ready for marketing efforts. This typically involves API calls to publish the campaign to the relevant platform.
11. **End**: The campaign creation process is complete.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign import AliCampaignEditor
from src.utils.string.html_simplification import strip_tags
from src.utils.printer import pprint

campaign_name = "Summer Sale"
language = "en"
currency = "USD"

campaign = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name, language, currency)
print(campaign.get_category("Electronics"))  # Example usage of a campaign method
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
