How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet is a Python script used for testing and experimenting with AliExpress campaign creation and processing within the 'hypotez' project. It defines a campaign editor for creating a new AliExpress campaign using a JSON file.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Imports:** The code imports necessary modules for handling campaigns, file system operations, printing, logging, and project configuration.
2. **Campaign Setup:** It defines a campaign name (`campaign_name`) and a campaign file (`campaign_file`) as placeholders for the campaign configuration.
3. **Campaign Editor Initialization:** It initializes a `AliCampaignEditor` instance using the defined campaign name and campaign file. This editor provides functionality for editing and managing AliExpress campaigns.
4. **Campaign Processing:** The code includes commented-out calls to `process_campaign` and `process_all_campaigns` functions, which likely handle the actual processing of campaigns based on the defined configuration. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Example of using the campaign editor
campaign_name = 'lighting'
campaign_file = 'EN_US.JSON'
campaign_editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name=campaign_name, campaign_file=campaign_file)

# Process a single campaign
process_campaign(campaign_name)

# Process all campaigns
process_all_campaigns()
```
