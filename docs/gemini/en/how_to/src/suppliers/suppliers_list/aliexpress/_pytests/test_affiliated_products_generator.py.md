**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This script tests the functionality of the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class, which is used to generate affiliated product data from AliExpress. The script focuses on testing the `check_and_process_affiliate_products` and `process_affiliate_products` methods.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Fixture setup**: The `ali_affiliated_products` fixture creates an instance of `AliAffiliatedProducts` with sample campaign and category information.
2. **Testing `check_and_process_affiliate_products`**: This test verifies that the `check_and_process_affiliate_products` method calls `process_affiliate_products` with the provided product URLs.
3. **Testing `process_affiliate_products`**: This test mocks external dependencies like `retrieve_product_details`, `ensure_https`, `save_image_from_url`, `save_video_from_url`, and `j_dumps`. It checks if the `process_affiliate_products` method correctly retrieves product details, ensures HTTPS links, saves images and videos, and returns processed products.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.affiliated_products_generator import AliAffiliatedProducts

# Create an instance of AliAffiliatedProducts
ali_affiliated_products = AliAffiliatedProducts("sample_campaign", "sample_category", "EN", "USD")

# Process a list of product URLs
product_urls = ["https://www.aliexpress.com/item/123.html", "456"]
processed_products = ali_affiliated_products.process_affiliate_products(product_urls)

# Access processed product information
for product in processed_products:
    print(product.product_id)
    print(product.promotion_link)
    print(product.product_main_image_url)
    print(product.product_video_url)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
