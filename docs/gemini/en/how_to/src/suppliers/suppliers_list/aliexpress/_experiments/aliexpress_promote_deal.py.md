**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block imports necessary modules and sets up a `AliPromoDeal` object for a specific deal named `deal_name`. It prepares the products for the deal and potentially performs other actions as indicated by the ellipses (â€¦). 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports the `header` module and the `AliPromoDeal` class from the `aliexpress` submodule within the `suppliers_list` package.
2. It defines a variable `deal_name` with the value '150624_baseus_deals'.
3. An instance of the `AliPromoDeal` class is created using the `deal_name` variable, creating an object named `a`.
4. The commented line `#products = a.prepare_products_for_deal()` suggests that the code likely calls the `prepare_products_for_deal()` method of the `AliPromoDeal` object to obtain the products for the deal. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
import header
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress import AliPromoDeal

deal_name = '150624_baseus_deals'
a = AliPromoDeal(deal_name)
products = a.prepare_products_for_deal()  # Extract products from the deal
# ... Further processing of products or deal information ... 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
