How to Use the `CampaignEditor` Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `CampaignEditor` class provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for editing AliExpress campaign data stored in JSON files. It allows users to open, load, view, and prepare campaign data. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the `CampaignEditor`:**
    - Create an instance of the `CampaignEditor` class, passing the parent widget and the main application instance (`main_app`) as arguments.
2. **Setup UI:**
    - The `setup_ui` method sets up the GUI elements:
        - Creates a `QScrollArea` for displaying the campaign data.
        - Adds buttons for opening JSON files, preparing campaigns, and displaying the selected file name.
        - Arranges these elements in a `QGridLayout`.
3. **Connect Signals:**
    - The `setup_connections` method connects signals to slots to handle user interactions, but is currently empty.
4. **Open File Dialog:**
    - The `open_file` method launches a file dialog to allow the user to select a JSON campaign file.
    - It then calls `load_file` to process the selected file.
5. **Load JSON File:**
    - The `load_file` method attempts to load the selected JSON file using `j_loads_ns`.
    - If successful, it updates the file name label, creates widgets based on the loaded data, and initializes the `AliCampaignEditor` object.
    - If there's an error, it displays a critical error message.
6. **Create Widgets:**
    - The `create_widgets` method dynamically creates input fields for the campaign data (title, description, promotion name) based on the loaded JSON data.
7. **Prepare Campaign:**
    - The `prepare_campaign` method, decorated with `@asyncSlot()`, is an asynchronous method that prepares the campaign data using the `AliCampaignEditor` object.
    - It displays a success message if the preparation succeeds, and an error message if it fails.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.aliexpress.gui.campaign import CampaignEditor

# Create a CampaignEditor instance
editor = CampaignEditor()

# Show the editor window
editor.show()

# Example of opening a file (replace with your file path)
editor.open_file("path/to/campaign.json")

# Example of preparing the campaign
editor.prepare_campaign()
```

**Note:** The `prepare_campaign` method is an asynchronous operation, so it might take some time to complete.
