**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet processes AliExpress advertising campaigns by handling campaign data, processing categories, and generating promotional materials. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Parse Arguments**: The code starts by parsing command-line arguments using the `argparse` module. This allows users to specify the campaign name, categories, language, currency, and whether to process all campaigns.
2. **Process Campaigns**: Based on the parsed arguments, the code either processes all campaigns or a specific campaign with specified categories, language, and currency. 
3. **Campaign Processing**: For each campaign and locale (language/currency), the code creates an `AliCampaignEditor` object and calls the `process_campaign()` method to process the campaign.
4. **Category Processing**: If specific categories are provided, the code iterates through each category and calls the `process_campaign_category()` method to process the category within the campaign.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Process a specific campaign with categories "electronics" and "fashion" for language "EN" and currency "USD"
    python src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaigns/prepare_campaigns.py summer_sale -c electronics fashion -l EN -cu USD

    # Process all campaigns for all locales 
    python src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaigns/prepare_campaigns.py --all
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
