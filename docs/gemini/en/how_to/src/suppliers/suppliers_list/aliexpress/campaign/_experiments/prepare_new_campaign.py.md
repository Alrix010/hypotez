**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a new campaign for AliExpress using the `AliCampaignEditor` class. The code imports necessary modules, defines the campaign name, initializes the `AliCampaignEditor` object, and then calls the `process_new_campaign` method to create and configure the new campaign.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. Imports required modules:
    - `header`: This module is not explicitly defined in the provided code. It needs to be defined or replaced with the actual module used.
    - `Path`: For handling file paths.
    - `gs`: This module is likely related to Google Sheets integration.
    - `AliCampaignEditor`: A class for creating and managing AliExpress campaigns.
    - `get_filenames`, `get_directory_names`: Functions for retrieving filenames and directory names.
    - `pprint`: A function for pretty printing data.
    - `logger`: A module for logging messages.

2. Sets the campaign name:
    - `campaign_name = 'rc'`: Defines the campaign name as "rc".

3. Initializes the `AliCampaignEditor`:
    - `aliexpress_editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name)`: Creates an instance of the `AliCampaignEditor` class with the specified campaign name.

4. Processes the new campaign:
    - `aliexpress_editor.process_new_campaign(campaign_name)`: Calls the `process_new_campaign` method of the `AliCampaignEditor` object, which initiates the campaign creation and configuration process.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign import AliCampaignEditor

campaign_name = 'my_new_campaign'
aliexpress_editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name)
aliexpress_editor.process_new_campaign(campaign_name)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
