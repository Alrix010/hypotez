**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

###  Tester's Guide 

#### Introduction

This document is intended for testers who will be verifying the module responsible for preparing materials for advertising campaigns on the AliExpress platform. The module includes three main files:

1. `edit_campaign.py` - campaign management.
2. `prepare_campaigns.py` - preparation and processing of campaign categories.
3. `test_campaign_integration.py` - tests for verifying the integration of all module components.


#### Main files

1. **`edit_campaign.py`**:
    - **Description**: This file contains the `AliCampaignEditor` class, which inherits from `AliPromoCampaign`. The main task of this class is to manage advertising campaigns.
    - **Key functions**:
        - `AliCampaignEditor`: Campaign initialization and management.

2. **`prepare_campaigns.py`**:
    - **Description**: This file contains functions for preparing campaign materials, including updating categories and processing campaigns by category.
    - **Key functions**:
        - `update_category`: Updates a category in a JSON file.
        - `process_campaign_category`: Processes a specific category within the campaign.
        - `process_campaign`: Processes the entire campaign across all categories.
        - `main`: Asynchronous main function for campaign processing.

3. **`test_campaign_integration.py`**:
    - **Description**: This file contains tests that verify the interaction of all module components.
    - **Key tests**:
        - `test_update_category_success`: Checks for successful category updates.
        - `test_update_category_failure`: Checks for error handling during category updates.
        - `test_process_campaign_category_success`: Checks for successful category processing.
        - `test_process_campaign_category_failure`: Checks for error handling during category processing.
        - `test_process_campaign`: Checks for processing all categories in the campaign.
        - `test_main`: Checks the main campaign execution scenario.

#### Testing Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**:
    - Make sure all necessary dependencies are installed. Run the command:
      ```sh
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

2. **Run tests**:
    - To run all tests, use the command:
      ```sh
      pytest test_campaign_integration.py
      ```

3. **Check tests**:
    - Ensure all tests pass successfully. The output of the `pytest` command should indicate that all tests have passed (`PASSED`).

#### Functional Testing

1. **Verify successful category update**:
    - The `test_update_category_success` test verifies that the category is successfully updated in the JSON file.
    - Ensure that the `update_category` function correctly updates the category data and logs successful execution.

2. **Verify error handling during category update**:
    - The `test_update_category_failure` test verifies error handling during category updates.
    - Ensure that in case of an error, the function logs an error message and returns `False`.

3. **Verify successful category processing**:
    - The `test_process_campaign_category_success` test verifies successful category processing in the campaign.
    - Ensure that the `process_campaign_category` function correctly processes the category and returns the result without errors.

4. **Verify error handling during category processing**:
    - The `test_process_campaign_category_failure` test verifies error handling during category processing.
    - Ensure that in case of an error, the function logs an error message and returns `None`.

5. **Verify processing all categories in the campaign**:
    - The `test_process_campaign` test verifies the processing of all categories in the campaign.
    - Ensure that the `process_campaign` function correctly processes all categories and returns the results of processing each category.

6. **Verify the main campaign execution scenario**:
    - The `test_main` test verifies the main campaign execution scenario.
    - Ensure that the `main` function correctly executes all stages of campaign processing asynchronously and without errors.

#### Conclusion

Ensure that all tests pass and the module's functionality is working correctly. In case of any problems or errors, report them to the developers for correction.
