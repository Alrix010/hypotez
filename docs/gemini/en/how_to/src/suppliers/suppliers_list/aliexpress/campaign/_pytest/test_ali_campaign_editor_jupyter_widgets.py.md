**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet contains unit tests for functions within the `src.utils.file.file` module. The functions tested include `save_text_file`, `read_text_file`, `get_filenames`, and `get_directory_names`. These tests utilize mocking to simulate file interactions and ensure the functions operate as expected.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Test `save_text_file`**:
    - `@patch` decorators are used to mock the `Path.open` and `Path.mkdir` functions for file interaction.
    - `mock_logger`, `mock_mkdir`, and `mock_file_open` are the mocked instances.
    - `save_text_file("test.txt", "This is a test.")` calls the function being tested, writing to the mocked file.
    - Assertions are used to verify the expected interactions with the mocked functions.
2. **Test `read_text_file`**:
    - `@patch` decorates the `Path.open` function, providing mock data ("This is a test.") for the file content.
    - `mock_file_open` is the mocked instance.
    - `read_text_file("test.txt")` reads from the mocked file.
    - The function returns the content, which is asserted against the expected value.
3. **Test `get_filenames`**:
    - `@patch` decorates `Path.iterdir`, providing mock directory entries (file1.txt, file2.txt) for the `iterdir` function.
    - `get_filenames(Path("/some/dir"))` calls the function being tested with a mocked path.
    - Assertions verify that the correct filenames are extracted from the mocked directory.
4. **Test `get_directory_names`**:
    - `@patch` decorates `Path.iterdir`, providing mock directory entries (dir1, dir2) for the `iterdir` function.
    - `get_directory_names(Path("/some/dir"))` calls the function being tested with a mocked path.
    - Assertions verify that the correct directory names are extracted from the mocked directory.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, mock_open, MagicMock
from src.utils.file.file import save_text_file

@patch("src.utils.file.file.Path.open", new_callable=mock_open)
@patch("src.utils.file.file.Path.mkdir")
@patch("src.utils.file.file.logger")
def test_save_text_file(mock_logger, mock_mkdir, mock_file_open):
    save_text_file("test.txt", "This is a test.")
    mock_file_open.assert_called_once_with("w", encoding="utf-8")
    mock_file_open().write.assert_called_once_with("This is a test.")
    mock_mkdir.assert_called_once()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
