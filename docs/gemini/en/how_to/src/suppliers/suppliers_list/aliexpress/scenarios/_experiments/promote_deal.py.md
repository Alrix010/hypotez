**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block creates a new instance of the `AliPromoDeal` class, retrieves all product details, and then proceeds with further actions (indicated by `...`).

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. Imports the necessary modules, including `header` and `AliPromoDeal` from the `aliexpress.scenarios` module.
2. Creates an instance of the `AliPromoDeal` class, named `deal`, with the campaign ID `'150624_baseus_deals'`.
3. Retrieves all product details associated with the campaign by calling the `get_all_products_details()` method on the `deal` object.
4. The code then moves on to further actions, as indicated by `...`.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.scenarios import AliPromoDeal

# Create an instance of the AliPromoDeal class
deal = AliPromoDeal('150624_baseus_deals')

# Get all product details
products = deal.get_all_products_details()

# ... (Continue with further actions)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
