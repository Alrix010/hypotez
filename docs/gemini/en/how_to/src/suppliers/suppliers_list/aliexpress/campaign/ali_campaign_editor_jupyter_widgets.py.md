**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a class `JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets` responsible for managing the AliExpress campaign editor in a Jupyter notebook environment. It provides widgets for selecting campaigns, categories, and languages, and offers functions for actions like initialization, saving campaigns, and showing products.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the Class**: Create an instance of `JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets` to access the widgets.
2. **Set up Dropdowns**: The class initializes widgets for campaign name, category, and language selection with default values.
3. **Define Callbacks**: The `setup_callbacks` method associates event handlers with the widgets, triggering specific actions based on user interaction.
4. **Display Widgets**: The `display_widgets` method displays the interactive widgets in the Jupyter notebook.
5. **Initialize Campaign Editor**: The `initialize_campaign_editor` method sets up the campaign editor with the selected campaign, category, and language.
6. **Interact with Widgets**: Users can select campaigns, categories, and languages using the dropdowns.
7. **Perform Actions**: The `save_campaign`, `show_products`, and `open_spreadsheet` methods handle actions triggered by corresponding buttons.
8. **Update Dropdowns**: The `update_category_dropdown` function updates the category dropdown based on the selected campaign, dynamically listing categories relevant to that campaign.


Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign import JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets

# Create an instance of the JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets
editor_widgets = JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets()

# Display the interactive widgets in the Jupyter notebook
editor_widgets.display_widgets() 

# Alternatively, manually select a campaign, category, and language
editor_widgets.campaign_name_dropdown.value = 'SummerSale'
editor_widgets.category_name_dropdown.value = 'Electronics'
editor_widgets.language_dropdown.value = 'EN USD'

# Initialize the campaign editor with the selected campaign
editor_widgets.initialize_campaign_editor(None) 

# Save the campaign
editor_widgets.save_campaign(None)

# Show products for the selected category
editor_widgets.show_products(None)

# Open the associated Google Spreadsheet
editor_widgets.open_spreadsheet(None) 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
