**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block initiates the process of preparing all AliExpress affiliate campaigns. 
If a campaign does not exist, a new one will be created.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. Import the `header` module, which likely contains necessary configuration or initialization settings for the AliExpress affiliate program.
2. Import the `process_all_campaigns` function from the `src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign` module.
3. Execute the `process_all_campaigns()` function, which manages the process of preparing all existing AliExpress affiliate campaigns or creating new ones.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Import necessary modules
    import header
    from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign import process_all_campaigns

    # Initiate the campaign preparation process
    process_all_campaigns()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
