**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a class `AliCampaignGoogleSheet` which manages a Google Sheets spreadsheet for AliExpress campaigns. It inherits from the `SpreadSheet` class and adds methods for managing sheets, recording data about categories and products, and formatting sheets.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `__init__` method initializes the `AliCampaignGoogleSheet` object with the spreadsheet ID, campaign name, language, and currency.
2. The `clear` method deletes existing product sheets and clears data from the 'categories' and 'product_template' sheets.
3. The `delete_products_worksheets` method deletes all sheets except 'categories', 'product', 'category', and 'campaign'.
4. The `set_campaign_worksheet` method writes campaign data to the 'campaign' worksheet.
5. The `set_products_worksheet` method writes data from a list of products for a specified category to a new worksheet.
6. The `set_categories_worksheet` method writes category data to the 'categories' worksheet.
7. The `get_categories` method retrieves category data from the 'categories' worksheet.
8. The `set_category_products` method writes product data for a specific category to a new worksheet.
9. The `_format_categories_worksheet` and `_format_category_products_worksheet` methods format the corresponding worksheets with column widths, row heights, and header styles.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign.gsheets_check_this_code import AliCampaignGoogleSheet

# Initialize AliCampaignGoogleSheet with campaign details
campaign_sheet = AliCampaignGoogleSheet(campaign_name='My Campaign', language='English', currency='USD')

# Set campaign data in the 'campaign' sheet
campaign_sheet.set_campaign_worksheet(campaign_sheet.editor.campaign)

# Set category data in the 'categories' sheet
campaign_sheet.set_categories_worksheet(campaign_sheet.editor.campaign.category)

# Set product data for a specific category
campaign_sheet.set_products_worksheet('Category Name') 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
