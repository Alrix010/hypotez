**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This module provides access to AliExpress supplier data through both the `HTTPS` (webdriver) and `API` protocols.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The module utilizes `webdriver` for direct access to product `html` pages via the `Driver` class. This enables the execution of data gathering scripts, including navigation across categories.
2. It leverages the `api` for retrieving `affiliate links` and concise product characteristics.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Example usage of the module:
    from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress import Aliexpress
    aliexpress = Aliexpress()
    product_details = aliexpress.get_product_details('product_id')
    affiliate_link = aliexpress.get_affiliate_link('product_id')
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".

## Module for Interactions with the `aliexpress.com` Supplier

This module provides access to supplier data through both the `HTTPS` (webdriver) and `API` protocols.

**webdriver**
- Direct access to product `html` pages via the `Driver` class. Enables executing scripts for gathering information, including navigation across categories.

**api**
- Used for retrieving `affiliate links` and brief product characteristics.


## Internal Modules:

### `utils`
Contains auxiliary functions and utility classes for performing general operations in the AliExpress integration. Likely includes tools for data formatting, error handling, logging, and other tasks that simplify interactions with the AliExpress ecosystem.

---

### `api`
Provides methods and classes for direct interaction with the AliExpress API. Likely includes functionality for sending requests, processing responses, and managing authentication, simplifying API interactions for retrieving or sending data.

---

### `campaign`
Designed to manage marketing campaigns on AliExpress. Likely includes tools for creating, updating, and tracking campaigns, as well as methods for analyzing their effectiveness and optimizing them based on provided metrics.
