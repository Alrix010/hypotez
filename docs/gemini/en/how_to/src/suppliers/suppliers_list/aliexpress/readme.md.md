How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block outlines the structure and functionality of a Python module designed for interacting with the AliExpress e-commerce platform. It provides access to AliExpress data through two primary methods: `webdriver` and `api`. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Defines the Module's Purpose:**  The code starts by declaring the module's role as a tool for interacting with the AliExpress platform.
2. **Explains `webdriver` Access:**  It describes the `webdriver` protocol, which enables direct access to AliExpress product pages using the `Driver` class. This allows for data collection and navigation through AliExpress categories.
3. **Explains `api` Access:** It details the `api` protocol, which is used to retrieve affiliate links and product descriptions.
4. **Introduces Internal Modules:** The code outlines the purpose of internal modules within the project, such as `utils`, `api`, `campaign`, `gui`, `locators`, and `scenarios`.
5. **Describes `utils` Module:**  It explains that the `utils` module contains helper functions and utility classes for simplifying AliExpress integration, likely including data formatting, error handling, logging, and other common operations.
6. **Describes `api` Module:**  It describes the `api` module, which provides methods and classes for direct interaction with the AliExpress API, handling requests, responses, and authentication.
7. **Describes `campaign` Module:**  It explains the `campaign` module, which focuses on managing AliExpress marketing campaigns, including creation, updating, tracking, and analyzing campaign effectiveness.
8. **Describes `gui` Module:**  It details the `gui` module, which offers graphical user interface elements for interacting with AliExpress functionality, including forms, dialogs, and other visual components.
9. **Describes `locators` Module:**  It explains the `locators` module, which defines element locators for use with WebDriver to automate data collection and actions on AliExpress pages.
10. **Describes `scenarios` Module:**  It describes the `scenarios` module, which defines complex sequences of actions for interacting with AliExpress, combining API requests, GUI interactions, and data processing for tasks like product synchronization, order management, or campaign execution.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Example usage:
from hypotez.src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.utils import some_helper_function
from hypotez.src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.api import get_product_details, get_affiliate_link

# Example usage of helper functions:
product_data = get_product_details(product_id)
affiliate_link = get_affiliate_link(product_id)
cleaned_data = some_helper_function(product_data) 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
