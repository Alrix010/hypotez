**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block checks for the existence of an affiliate program for a given advertising campaign. If the campaign doesn't exist, it creates a new one.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import Necessary Modules**:  The code imports the `header` module and the `process_campaign` function from the `src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign` module.
2. **Define Campaign Parameters**: It defines a dictionary `locales` with language-currency mappings. It also specifies the language (`language`), currency (`currency`), and campaign name (`campaign_name`).
3. **Check for Existing Campaign**: It checks for the existence of a campaign with the specified name (`campaign_name`). 
4. **Create New Campaign**: If the campaign doesn't exist, it creates a new one using the `process_campaign` function. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign import process_campaign

locales = {'EN': 'USD', 'HE': 'ILS', 'RU': 'ILS'}
language: str = 'EN'
currency: str = 'USD'
campaign_name: str = 'brands'

# Check for existing campaign and create a new one if needed
process_campaign(campaign_name=campaign_name, language=language, currency=currency)

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
