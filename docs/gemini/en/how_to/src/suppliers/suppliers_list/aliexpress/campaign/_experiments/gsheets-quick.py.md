**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code snippet defines and executes a function named `save_campaign_from_worksheet` from the `AliCampaignGoogleSheet` class. This function appears to read data from a Google Sheet representing a campaign and saves it into the campaign database. The code snippet also provides examples of using the `AliCampaignGoogleSheet` class for different campaign and category types.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The script imports necessary modules for Google Sheets integration, campaign management, and printing.
2. It defines a campaign name (`lighting`), category name (`chandeliers`), language (`EN`), and currency (`USD`).
3. An instance of `AliCampaignGoogleSheet` class is created using the defined campaign name, language, and currency.
4. The script then sets the products worksheet using the defined category name.
5. It calls `save_campaign_from_worksheet` to save the campaign data from the Google Sheet to the database.
6. The script continues with additional tasks indicated by the `...` placeholder.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign import AliCampaignGoogleSheet
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign.ttypes import CampaignType, CategoryType, ProductType

campaign_name = "lighting"
category_name = "chandeliers"
language = 'EN'
currency = 'USD'

gs = AliCampaignGoogleSheet(campaign_name=campaign_name, language=language, currency=currency)

gs.set_products_worksheet(category_name)
gs.save_campaign_from_worksheet()

# Additional code using the AliCampaignGoogleSheet instance
...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
