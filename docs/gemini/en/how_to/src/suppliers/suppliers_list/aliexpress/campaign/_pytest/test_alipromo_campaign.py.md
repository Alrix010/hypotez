**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a Python test suite for the `AliPromoCampaign` class, responsible for managing AliExpress promotional campaigns. It uses PyTest framework to test the class functionality.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1.  **Import Dependencies:** Import necessary libraries such as `pytest` for testing, `Pathlib` for file path manipulation, `SimpleNamespace` for creating simple objects, `AliPromoCampaign` from the project, `j_dumps` and `j_loads_ns` for JSON operations, `save_text_file` for file handling, and `gs` for accessing Google Sheets.

2. **Define Test Data:** Define sample data like campaign name, category name, language, and currency for testing purposes.

3. **Create Fixture:** Define a `pytest` fixture named `campaign` that creates an instance of the `AliPromoCampaign` class using the sample data.

4. **Test Methods:** Define test functions for each method of the `AliPromoCampaign` class. Each test function:
    - Takes the `campaign` fixture as an argument.
    - Uses `mocker` to mock external dependencies and control their behavior during testing.
    - Executes the method under test with appropriate arguments.
    - Asserts the expected outcome using assertions to validate the method's correctness.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Example usage of the test suite:
# Running all tests:
pytest -v src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/_pytest/test_alipromo_campaign.py
# Running specific test:
pytest -v src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/_pytest/test_alipromo_campaign.py::test_initialize_campaign

# Example of modifying a test:
def test_initialize_campaign(mocker, campaign):
    """Test the initialize_campaign method."""
    mock_json_data = {
        "name": campaign_name,
        "title": "Modified Test Campaign",  # Change the expected title
        "language": language,
        "currency": currency,
        # ...
    }
    mocker.patch("src.utils.jjson.j_loads_ns", return_value=SimpleNamespace(**mock_json_data))
    
    campaign.initialize_campaign()
    assert campaign.campaign.name == campaign_name
    assert campaign.campaign.category.test_category.name == category_name
    assert campaign.campaign.title == "Modified Test Campaign"  # Assert the modified title
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
