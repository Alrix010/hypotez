**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the `ProductEditor` Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `ProductEditor` class provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for editing product data in the `hypotez` project. It allows users to open and load JSON files containing product information, display the data, and prepare the product for further processing.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an instance of the `ProductEditor` class, passing the parent widget (if applicable) and the main application (`MainApp`) as arguments.
   - The `__init__` method sets up the UI and connections between widgets.
2. **UI Setup:**
   - `setup_ui()` method creates and arranges the UI elements:
     - An "Open JSON File" button to open a file dialog for selecting a JSON file.
     - A label to display the name of the selected file.
     - A "Prepare Product" button to trigger the product preparation process.
3. **Open File:**
   - The `open_file()` method is called when the "Open JSON File" button is clicked.
   - It opens a file dialog and allows the user to select a JSON file.
   - If a file is selected, the `load_file()` method is called to load the data from the file.
4. **Load File:**
   - The `load_file()` method attempts to load the selected JSON file using `j_loads_ns`.
   - If successful, it stores the data in the `data` attribute, sets the file path, updates the file name label, and creates an instance of `AliCampaignEditor` for further processing.
   - If an error occurs, an error message is displayed using `QtWidgets.QMessageBox.critical`.
5. **Create Widgets:**
   - The `create_widgets()` method dynamically creates widgets based on the loaded data.
   - It first removes any previous widgets from the layout, except for the "Open JSON File" button and file label.
   - It then creates and adds a title label and additional product details labels to the layout, based on the information in the loaded data.
6. **Prepare Product:**
   - The `prepare_product_async()` method is called when the "Prepare Product" button is clicked.
   - It asynchronously calls the `prepare_product()` method of the `AliCampaignEditor` instance.
   - If the preparation is successful, a success message is displayed.
   - If an error occurs, an error message is displayed.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.gui.product import ProductEditor

# Create an instance of ProductEditor
product_editor = ProductEditor()

# Show the editor window
product_editor.show()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
