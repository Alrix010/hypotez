**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block parses an Excel table that contains data related to deals from AliExpress. It uses the `DealsFromXLS` class to process the data and extract individual deals. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules**:  Imports the `header` module, the `DealsFromXLS` class from the `aliexpress` module within the `suppliers_list` package, and the `pprint` function from the `printer` module.
2. **Instantiate the DealsFromXLS class**: Creates an instance of the `DealsFromXLS` class with the specified language (`EN`) and currency (`USD`).
3. **Iterate through deals**: The code iterates through the deals returned by the `get_next_deal()` method of the `DealsFromXLS` instance. For each deal, it prints the deal details using the `pprint` function.
4. **Process each deal**: Within the loop, you can add additional code to process the deal data as needed, such as saving it to a database or performing other actions.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress import DealsFromXLS
from src.utils.printer import pprint

# Initialize the deals parser
deals_parser = DealsFromXLS(language='EN', currency='USD')

# Iterate through deals and print their details
for deal in deals_parser.get_next_deal():
    pprint(deal)

    # Process the deal data as needed
    # ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
