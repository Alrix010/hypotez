**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use the AliRequests Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `AliRequests` class is responsible for handling requests to AliExpress using the `requests` library. It initializes a session with cookies loaded from a webdriver file, manages session ID, and provides methods for making GET requests and generating short affiliate links.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:**
   - The class is initialized with the name of the webdriver for loading cookies (`webdriver_for_cookies`).
   - Cookies are loaded from a webdriver file in the specified directory (`gs.dir_cookies`).
   - A session is created using the `requests.Session()` object.
   - Headers are set with a random user agent.

2. **Loading Cookies:**
   - The `_load_webdriver_cookies_file()` method loads cookies from a webdriver file.
   - It attempts to open the file and read the cookies using `pickle.load()`.
   - Each cookie is set in the `requests.cookie.RequestsCookieJar` object.
   - If the cookies are successfully loaded, the method refreshes the session cookies.

3. **Refreshing Session Cookies:**
   - The `_refresh_session_cookies()` method refreshes the session cookies by making a GET request to `https://portals.aliexpress.com`.
   - It then handles the `JSESSIONID` cookie in the response.

4. **Handling JSESSIONID:**
   - The `_handle_session_id()` method handles the `JSESSIONID` cookie in response cookies.
   - If the `JSESSIONID` is not found, a warning message is logged.

5. **Making GET Requests:**
   - The `make_get_request()` method makes a GET request to the specified URL with cookies and optional headers.
   - It updates the session cookies with the `RequestsCookieJar` and makes the request using `requests.session.get()`.
   - The method handles potential errors and returns the response object if successful.

6. **Generating Short Affiliate Links:**
   - The `short_affiliate_link()` method generates a short affiliate link for the given URL.
   - It constructs the URL for the affiliate link generator and makes a GET request to it.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.alirequests import AliRequests

# Initialize AliRequests with Chrome webdriver for cookies
aliexpress_requests = AliRequests(webdriver_for_cookies='chrome')

# Make a GET request to a product page
url = "https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10000000000000000.html"  # Replace with actual product URL
response = aliexpress_requests.make_get_request(url)

if response:
    # Process the response
    print(response.text)

# Generate a short affiliate link
long_url = "https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10000000000000000.html"  # Replace with actual URL
short_link_response = aliexpress_requests.short_affiliate_link(long_url)

if short_link_response:
    # Process the short link response
    print(short_link_response.text)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
