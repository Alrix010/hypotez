**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block demonstrates how to update a campaign in AliCampaignEditor using data from a Google Sheet. It reads category data from a Google Sheet, updates the category information, and then updates the campaign in AliCampaignEditor with the new category data.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize Google Sheet and Campaign Editor:**
    -  The code initializes an `AliCampaignGoogleSheet` object with a Google Sheet ID ('1nu4mNNFMzSePlggaaL_QM2vdKVP_NNBl2OG7R9MNrs0') and an `AliCampaignEditor` object with a specific campaign name, language, and currency.
2. **Retrieve and Update Categories:**
    - The code retrieves category data from the Google Sheet using `gs.get_categories()`.
    - It then iterates through the retrieved categories, updates their information, and sets the updated categories back to the Google Sheet using `gs.set_categories()`.
3. **Update Category Products:**
    - The code updates product data for each category by retrieving the products from the campaign editor using `campaign_editor.get_category_products()`.
    - Then, it sets the products back to the Google Sheet using `gs.set_category_products()`.
4. **Create Campaign Dictionary:**
    - The code creates a dictionary representing the updated campaign, including the campaign name, title, language, currency, and the updated categories.
5. **Update Campaign in AliCampaignEditor:**
    - The code updates the campaign in AliCampaignEditor using the `campaign_editor.update_campaign()` function, passing the updated campaign dictionary as an argument.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign import AliCampaignGoogleSheet, AliCampaignEditor
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign.ttypes import CampaignType, CategoryType, ProductType

# Google Sheet ID
gs_id = '1nu4mNNFMzSePlggaaL_QM2vdKVP_NNBl2OG7R9MNrs0'

# Campaign details
campaign_name = "lighting"
language = 'EN'
currency = 'USD'

# Initialize Google Sheet and Campaign Editor
gs = AliCampaignGoogleSheet(gs_id)
campaign_editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name, language, currency)

# Update campaign with data from Google Sheet
edited_campaign = update_campaign_from_gsheet(gs, campaign_editor)

# ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
