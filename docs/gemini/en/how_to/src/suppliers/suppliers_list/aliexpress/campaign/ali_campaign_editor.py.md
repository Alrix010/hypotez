**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `AliCampaignEditor` class provides functionality for managing advertising campaigns on AliExpress. It inherits from the `AliPromoCampaign` class and implements methods for deleting products, updating products, updating campaign properties, updating categories, retrieving categories, listing categories, and retrieving category products.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the AliCampaignEditor:**
    - Create an instance of `AliCampaignEditor` with the required parameters, such as `campaign_name`, `language`, and `currency`.
    - Optionally, provide the path to a `<lang>_<currency>.json` file to load the campaign data.

2. **Perform Campaign Management Operations:**
    - Use methods like `delete_product`, `update_product`, `update_campaign`, `update_category`, `get_category`, `list_categories`, and `get_category_products` to manage different aspects of the campaign.

3. **Access Campaign Data:**
    - Use the `campaign` attribute to access campaign-related information, such as the `category` attribute.

4. **Utilize Helper Methods:**
    - Use the `extract_prod_ids`, `ensure_https`, `j_loads_ns`, `j_loads`, `j_dumps`, `csv2dict`, `read_text_file`, `get_filenames_from_directory`, and `get_directory_names` functions for various utility operations.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign.ali_campaign_editor import AliCampaignEditor

# Initialize the campaign editor
editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name="Summer Sale", language="EN", currency="USD")

# Delete a product that does not have an affiliate link
editor.delete_product("12345")

# Update a product within a category
editor.update_product("Electronics", "EN", {"product_id": "12345", "title": "Smartphone"})

# Get a list of categories in the campaign
categories = editor.list_categories
print(categories)

# Retrieve products for a category
products = editor.get_category_products("Electronics")
print(products)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
