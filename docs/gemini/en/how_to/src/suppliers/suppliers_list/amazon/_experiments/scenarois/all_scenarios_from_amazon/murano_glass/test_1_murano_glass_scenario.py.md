**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block is a scenario for scraping product data from Amazon. It defines a product URL and uses web scraping techniques to extract information like the product's ASIN, name, and additional image URLs. Then, it checks if the product already exists in the PrestaShop database. If it does, it updates the product's image. If it doesn't, it creates a new product entry in the database. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Define Scenario:** Sets up a dictionary `s.current_scenario` to hold the URL of the product to be scraped, its condition, PrestaShop categories, and pricing rules.
2. **Initialize Components:**
    - Sets `l` to the product locators from the supplier class.
    - Defines `d` as an instance of the `Driver` class.
    - Assigns `_` to the `execute_locator` method of the `Driver` class for convenient access.
3. **Load Product Page:** Navigates to the product page specified in `s.current_scenario["url"]` using `d.get_url()`.
4. **Extract ASIN:**  Uses `_(l['ASIN'])` to get the product's ASIN from the page.
5. **Generate Product Reference:** Creates a unique `product_reference` string combining the supplier ID and the ASIN.
6. **Check for Existing Product:** Calls `Product.check_if_product_in_presta_db(product_reference)` to see if the product is already in the PrestaShop database.
7. **Process Product Update:** 
    - If the product exists in the database (`product_id` is not `False`), it extracts the `default_image_url` from the product page and uses `Product.upload_image2presta()` to update the image in PrestaShop. 
    - If the product doesn't exist, the code continues to the next step.
8. **Scrape Product Data:** If the product doesn't exist in the database, it calls `Product.grab_product_page()` to collect information from the product page and store it in a `product_fields` object.
9. **Prepare Product Dictionary:**  Creates a dictionary `product_dict` containing the product information gathered in the previous step, including the name, price, and other fields.
10. **Add Product to PrestaShop:** (The code snippet ends before this step). The final step would likely involve using the `product_dict` to add the product to the PrestaShop database using methods like `PrestaProduct.add()`.


Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Example: Scraping a Murano Glass product from Amazon

# Set the product URL and other scenario details
s.current_scenario = {
    "url": "https://amzn.to/3OhRz2g",
    "condition": "new",
    "presta_categories": {
        "default_category": { "11209": "MURANO GLASS" },
        "additional_categories": [ "" ]
    },
    "price_rule": 1
}

# Run the scraping scenario
# ... (rest of the code from the snippet)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
