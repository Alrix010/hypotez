**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the Graber Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Graber` class is designed to collect product data from Amazon. It inherits from the base `Graber` class and provides methods to handle various product fields on the page. This specific `Graber` implementation focuses on the `amazon` supplier.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `Graber` class is initialized with a `Driver` object (representing the web browser) and a `lang_index` (indicating the language of the page).
2. **Global Settings**: The `Config.locator_for_decorator` attribute is set to `None`. If a locator is provided, it will be used in the `close_pop_up` decorator to handle any pop-up windows.
3. **Decorator**: The `close_pop_up` decorator (which is a template for creating custom decorators) can be used to implement pre-processing logic before executing the main function. This decorator can be customized as needed.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.amazon.graber import Graber
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver

# Initialize the Graber class with a Driver object and language index
driver = Driver(Chrome) # or Firefox, Playwright etc.
graber = Graber(driver, 0)

# Access and manipulate product data using graber.product_data
# For example:
print(graber.product_data.title)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
