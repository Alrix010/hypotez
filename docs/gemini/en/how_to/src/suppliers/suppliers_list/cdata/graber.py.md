**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code defines a class `Graber` that extends the base class `src.suppliers.graber.Graber`. This class is responsible for collecting product data from the Cdata website. It inherits methods for handling different product fields from the parent class and allows for overriding methods for custom field processing.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**:
    - The `Graber` class is initialized with a `Driver` instance and a `lang_index`. 
    - It sets the `supplier_prefix` attribute to 'cdata' and initializes the base class with this prefix, the driver instance, and the language index.
    - It configures the `Config.locator_for_decorator` attribute for potential use in a decorator.
2. **Decorator Implementation**:
    - The code includes a template for a decorator that can be used to close pop-up windows before executing the main function logic.
    - The decorator (`close_pop_up`) is defined but commented out, allowing for custom implementation.
    - If you need to create your own decorator, you can uncomment and customize the template.
    - The `Config.locator_for_decorator` attribute will be used by the decorator to identify the locator to execute.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.cdata.graber import Graber
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver

# Initialize a Driver instance (e.g., Chrome)
driver = Driver(Chrome)

# Initialize a Graber instance with the driver and language index
graber = Graber(driver, lang_index=0)

# Use the Graber instance to access its methods for collecting data
# For example:
product_data = graber.get_product_details(product_url="https://www.bangood.com/product/example-product-url")

# Access specific fields from the product_data dictionary
print(product_data['name'])
print(product_data['price'])
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
