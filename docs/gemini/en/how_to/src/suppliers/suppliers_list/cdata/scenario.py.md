**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet extracts a list of product URLs from a category page on the supplier's website. It interacts with the `Supplier` class to access the `driver` object and the `locators` dictionary.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize Variables**: The code starts by retrieving the `locators` dictionary from the `Supplier` object. 
2. **Close Banners**: The code executes the locator for closing any banner elements on the page, using the `execute_locator` method of the `driver` object. 
3. **Scroll**: The code scrolls the page using the `scroll` method of the `driver` object.
4. **Extract Product Links**:  The code uses the `execute_locator` method to find all product links using the `product_links` locator from the `locators` dictionary.
5. **Handle Empty Results**: If no product links are found, the code logs a warning message and returns `None`.
6. **Format Results**: The code ensures that the `list_products_in_category` variable is a list, even if it contains a single product URL.
7. **Log Results**: The code logs the number of found products.
8. **Return Results**: Finally, the code returns the list of product URLs.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.suppliers.bangood.scenario import get_list_products_in_category
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.suppliers import Supplier

# Create a Supplier object
supplier = Supplier(
    name="bangood", 
    url="https://www.bangood.com/category/20500100.html", 
    ...
)

# Get product URLs from the category page
products = get_list_products_in_category(supplier)

# Check if products were found
if products:
    print(f"Found {len(products)} products.")
    # Process the list of product URLs
else:
    print("No products found.")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
