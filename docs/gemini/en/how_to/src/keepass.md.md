**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the KeePass Integration
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet interacts with a KeePass database file (`credentials.kdbx`) to load various credentials and API keys for different services. It uses the `pykeepass` library to access and parse the KeePass database. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Open the KeePass Database:**
    - The `_open_kp` method opens the `credentials.kdbx` file. 
    - It attempts to read the password from a `password.txt` file, if it exists, or prompts the user for the password.
    - If the opening fails, the method retries multiple times.
    - If all attempts fail, the program exits.
2. **Load Credentials:**
    - After successful opening, the `_load_credentials` method is called, which in turn calls loading methods for each category of credentials.
    - These methods use `kp.find_groups` to locate groups and entries within the KeePass database.
    - The necessary data (API keys, passwords, logins) are extracted from each entry using `entry.custom_properties` and `entry.password`.
3. **Extract Credentials:**
    - For each service, the code searches for a specific group in the KeePass database. 
    - It retrieves credentials (like API keys, tokens, passwords) from custom properties and passwords associated with entries in that group. 
    - This data is stored in the `ProgramSettings.credentials` object as attributes for the respective service. 
    - For services with multiple entries (like PrestaShop clients), the data is stored as `SimpleNamespace` objects in a list. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Accessing credentials from ProgramSettings
from hypotez.src.keepass import ProgramSettings

# Accessing OpenAI credentials
openai_credentials = ProgramSettings.credentials.openai

# Accessing PrestaShop client credentials (first client)
first_prestashop_client = ProgramSettings.credentials.presta.client[0]

# Accessing SMTP server credentials
smtp_credentials = ProgramSettings.credentials.smtp[0]
```
