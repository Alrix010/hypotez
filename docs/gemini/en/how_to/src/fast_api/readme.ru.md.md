2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code implements a remote control system for a FastAPI server using XML-RPC. The system consists of two parts: 
- `fast_api_rpc.py` (server-side): Handles server management functionalities through XML-RPC calls.
- `main.py` (client-side): Provides a user interface for interacting with the server via XML-RPC.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Start `fast_api_rpc.py`:**
    - Creates an instance of `CommandHandler`.
    - Initializes an XML-RPC server listening on port 9000.
    - Starts the FastAPI server(s) defined in the code.
2. **Start `main.py`:**
    - Creates an instance of `CommandHandler` (not used actively in `main.py`, as it only interacts with the RPC client).
    - Creates a `ServerProxy` to connect to the XML-RPC server at `http://localhost:9000`.
    - Displays a menu and waits for user input in `main.py`.
3. **User Inputs a Command:** For example, `start 8000`:
    - `main.py` parses the command, identifying `start` and `8000` as the command and its argument.
    - `main.py` calls the `start_server(port=8000, host="0.0.0.0")` method on the `rpc_client` object. This is a remote call to the XML-RPC server, not a local method call.
4. **Server Processes the Request:** 
    - The XML-RPC client (`rpc_client`) creates an XML message and sends it to the server (`fast_api_rpc.py`).
    - The XML-RPC server in `fast_api_rpc.py` receives the request.
    - It identifies that the `start_server` method of the `CommandHandler` object needs to be called.
    - The `start_server` method is executed, starting the FastAPI server.
5. **Response is Returned:**
    - The XML-RPC server constructs a response containing the result of the call (in this case, potentially `None`).
    - The response is sent back to the client (`main.py`).
    - The client receives the response.
6. **Result is Displayed:** `main.py` displays the result in the console (or ignores it if it's None).
7. **Loop Continues:** `main.py` returns to the beginning of the loop, displaying the menu and waiting for the next command.

**Key Points:**

* **Separation of Responsibilities:** `fast_api_rpc.py` manages the server and provides the management interface, `main.py` handles user interaction and sending commands.
* **XML-RPC:** `xmlrpc` facilitates communication between the two processes, allowing methods on the server to be called from the client program.
* **Threading:** The XML-RPC server runs in a separate thread, enabling it to operate concurrently with other code.
* **Remote Call:** `ServerProxy` lets methods be called as if they were part of the local code, even though they're actually executed on a remote server.

**Benefits of This Approach:**

* **Server Management from a Separate Program:** We can control the running server through another process or even from a different machine.
* **Code Separation:** The server management logic and user interface are separated, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
* **Flexibility:** We can add new server management methods simply by adding them to `CommandHandler`, and they'll automatically become available through RPC.
