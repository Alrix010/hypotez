**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `make_summary` function creates a `SUMMARY.md` file for the `mdbook` compilation process. It iterates through the provided `src_dir` and generates a list of links to all `.md` files, excluding `SUMMARY.md`. The function also filters files based on the specified language (`lang` parameter) and creates a relative path for each file, referencing the `src_dir` parent directory.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `make_summary` function is called with the `docs_dir` (source directory) and `lang` (language filter) as arguments.
2. The `prepare_summary_path` function is called to construct the path to the `SUMMARY.md` file within the `docs` directory.
3. The `_make_summary` function is called, which recursively iterates through the `src_dir` to find all `.md` files.
4. The `_make_summary` function filters files based on the `lang` parameter and generates links to the files within the `SUMMARY.md` file.
5. The `SUMMARY.md` file is saved in the `docs` directory.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Example Usage
    from src.endpoints.hypo69.code_assistant.make_summary import make_summary
    from pathlib import Path
    
    # Set the source directory and language
    src_dir = Path("./src") 
    lang = "en"
    
    # Create the SUMMARY.md file
    make_summary(src_dir, lang)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
