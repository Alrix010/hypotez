**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block is part of the `make_summary.py` module, which is used to generate the `SUMMARY.md` file for documentation compilation using tools like `mdbook`. It recursively traverses a directory containing Markdown files and builds a table of contents for them. It also supports filtering files based on language, allowing you to either include or exclude files with specific language suffixes (e.g., '.ru.md', '.en.md'). 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Imports**:
    - Imports necessary libraries, including `os`, `pathlib`, and `sys`. 
2. **Check Language**:
    - Uses the `argparse` module to parse command-line arguments.
    - Extracts the language filter (`-lang`) and source directory (`src`) arguments.
    - Validates the language filter argument, ensuring it is either `ru` or `en`.
3. **Recursive Traversal**:
    - Iterates through the specified directory (e.g., `src`) recursively.
    - Processes each file, checking if it is a Markdown file. 
4. **Create SUMMARY.md**:
    - If the language filter is `ru`, it includes files with the `.ru.md` suffix.
    - If the language filter is `en`, it includes files with the `.en.md` suffix, excluding those with the `.ru.md` suffix.
    - Generates a `SUMMARY.md` file in the `docs` directory, listing all included files with their corresponding relative paths. 
5. **Cleanup**:
    - Prints a confirmation message indicating the completion of the `SUMMARY.md` generation. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Run the make_summary.py script for Russian language files in the 'src' directory:
    python src/endpoints/hypo69/code_assistant/make_summary.py -lang ru src
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
