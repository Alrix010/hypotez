**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the `OnelaBot` Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `OnelaBot` class handles interactions with the Telegram bot. It provides methods to process text messages and uploaded documents using a large language model (LLM) to generate responses.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the Bot:** The `__init__` method initializes the `OnelaBot` instance. It sets up the bot's connection to Telegram and initializes the LLM model (Google Generative AI) for processing requests.
2. **Handle Text Messages:** The `handle_message` method processes incoming text messages. It retrieves the message text, the user ID, and then uses the LLM model to generate a response. The response is sent back to the user.
3. **Handle Document Uploads:** The `handle_document` method handles uploaded documents. It retrieves the document, saves it locally, and uses the LLM model to process it. The response is sent back to the user.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.hypo69.code_assistant.onela_bot import OnelaBot

# Initialize the bot
bot = OnelaBot()

# Start the bot's polling loop (continuously listening for updates)
asyncio.run(bot.application.run_polling())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
