**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet configures the setup.py file for the `gpt4free` project, defining the project's metadata, dependencies, and entry points. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Imports**:  Import necessary libraries for setup.py, including `codecs`, `os`, and `setuptools`.
2. **Project Directory**: Determine the absolute path of the current directory using `os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))`.
3. **Read README**: Read the `README.md` file and store its content in `long_description`, replacing placeholders with URLs.
4. **Define Dependencies**: Specify the required dependencies for the project in `INSTALL_REQUIRE`.
5. **Define Extra Dependencies**: Define optional dependencies grouped by feature in `EXTRA_REQUIRE`.
6. **Project Metadata**: Set up the project metadata, including the name, version, author, description, long description, packages, entry points, and other details.
7. **Execute Setup**: Use `setup()` from `setuptools` to build the project distribution.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# In the project's root directory, run:
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
# Or:
pip install . 
# This will install the project and its dependencies. 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
