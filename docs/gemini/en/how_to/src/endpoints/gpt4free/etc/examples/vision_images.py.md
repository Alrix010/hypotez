**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `gpt4free` library to analyze images using the `gpt4free.models.default_vision` model. It processes both remote and local images, sending them to the GPT-4Free API and receiving a response describing the image's content.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import Necessary Modules**: The code begins by importing the required modules, including `g4f` for interacting with the GPT-4Free API, `requests` for handling HTTP requests, and `Client` from the `g4f.client` module.

2. **Create a Client**: An instance of the `Client` class is created, which will be used to communicate with the GPT-4Free API.

3. **Process Remote Image**:
    - **Download Remote Image**: The code downloads an image from a remote URL using the `requests` library.
    - **Send Image to API**: The downloaded image is sent to the GPT-4Free API using the `client.chat.completions.create` method.
    - **Specify Model**: The `model` parameter is set to `g4f.models.default_vision` to indicate the desired vision model.
    - **Provide User Message**: A message is included with the request to specify the task. In this case, the message asks "What are on this image?".
    - **Get API Response**: The response from the API is stored in the `response_remote` variable.

4. **Process Local Image**:
    - **Open Local Image**: The code opens a local image file in read-binary mode.
    - **Send Image to API**: The local image is sent to the GPT-4Free API using the same `client.chat.completions.create` method.
    - **Get API Response**: The response from the API is stored in the `response_local` variable.

5. **Print Responses**: The code prints the responses received from the API for both the remote and local images.

6. **Close Local Image File**: The `local_image` file is closed using the `local_image.close()` method to free up resources.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
import g4f
import requests

from g4f.client import Client

client = Client()

# Processing a remote image
remote_image = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtekky/gpt4free/refs/heads/main/docs/images/cat.jpeg", stream=True).content
response_remote = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=g4f.models.default_vision,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are on this image?"}
    ],
    image=remote_image
)
print("Response for remote image:")
print(response_remote.choices[0].message.content)

# Processing a local image
local_image = open("docs/images/cat.jpeg", "rb")
response_local = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=g4f.models.default_vision,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are on this image?"}
    ],
    image=local_image
)
print("Response for local image:")
print(response_local.choices[0].message.content)
local_image.close()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
