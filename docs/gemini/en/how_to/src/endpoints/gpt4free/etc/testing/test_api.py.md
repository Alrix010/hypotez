**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `openai` library to interact with the GPT-3.5-turbo model for generating text. It sends a prompt to the model and receives a response, either in a single response or as a stream of tokens. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import OpenAI library**: `import openai`
2. **Set API key and base URL**:
    - `openai.api_key = "YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN"`: Sets the API key. Replace `"YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN"` with your actual Hugging Face token.
    - `openai.api_base = "http://localhost:1337/v1"`: Sets the API base URL. Modify this if you need to connect to a different OpenAI endpoint.
3. **Define `main` function**: 
    - This function defines the core logic for interacting with the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
4. **Create a ChatCompletion request**:
    - `response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)`: This line initiates a request to the OpenAI API using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. 
    - `messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "write a poem about a tree"}]`: The prompt is sent to the model as a list of messages. In this case, the prompt is "write a poem about a tree".
    - `stream=True`: Enables streaming response, allowing tokens to be received incrementally.
5. **Handle the response**:
    - If the response is a dictionary, it's not streaming and the generated text is printed directly from `response.choices[0].message.content`.
    - If the response is a generator, it's streaming and the generated text is printed one token at a time from `token["choices"][0]["delta"].get("content")`.
6. **Execute `main` function**:
    - `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` runs the `main` function if the script is executed directly.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    import openai

    # Set your API key and base URL (replace with your actual values)
    openai.api_key = "YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN"
    openai.api_base = "http://localhost:1337/v1"

    def main():
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short story about a cat and a dog who become friends."}],
            stream=True,
        )
        if isinstance(response, dict):
            # Not streaming
            print(response.choices[0].message.content)
        else:
            # Streaming
            for token in response:
                content = token["choices"][0]["delta"].get("content")
                if content is not None:
                    print(content, end="", flush=True)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
