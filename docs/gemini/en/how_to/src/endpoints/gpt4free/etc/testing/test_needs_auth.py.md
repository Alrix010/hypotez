**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet performs a series of API calls to different GPT-like models, such as OpenAI, Bing, and Bard, to assess their response speed and functionality. It tests both asynchronous and synchronous API requests, and measures the time taken to process the requests. It also tests different streaming modes, like `stream=True`, `stream=False`, and `stream=None`.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import Modules**:  Import required modules like `sys`, `Path`, `asyncio`, `g4f` (GPT4Free library), and custom testing functions like `log_time`, `log_time_async`, and `log_time_yield`.
2. **Define Constants**: Define variables like `_providers` (a list of GPT-like models to test), `_instruct` (a test message to send), and `_example` (a string that illustrates expected output).
3. **Test Bing API with Streaming**:  A `for` loop iterates through the output of `log_time_yield` function. This function measures the execution time for each response chunk received from the Bing API, and prints the output to the console.
4. **Run Asynchronous API Calls**: The `run_async` function uses `asyncio.gather` to concurrently make API calls to all the providers in `_providers` list. It measures the execution time for each API call and prints the results.
5. **Run Synchronous API Calls with Streaming**: The `run_stream` function loops through each provider in `_providers` list, and iterates through the output of `log_time_yield` function. This function measures the execution time for each response chunk received from the API calls and prints the output.
6. **Run Synchronous API Calls without Streaming**: The `create_no_stream` function loops through each provider in `_providers` list. It makes API calls without enabling streaming mode, measures the execution time, and prints the output.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.etc.testing.test_needs_auth import _providers, _instruct, run_async, run_stream, create_no_stream
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.etc.testing.log_time import log_time_yield

# Execute asynchronous API calls
asyncio.run(run_async())

# Execute synchronous API calls with streaming
run_stream()

# Execute synchronous API calls without streaming
create_no_stream()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
