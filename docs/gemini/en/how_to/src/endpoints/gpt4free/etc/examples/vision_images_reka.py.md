**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `gpt4free` library to perform image analysis with Reca. It allows you to send an image to the Reca model and receive a textual description of the image's content.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** Imports `Client` from `g4f.client` and `Reka` from `g4f.Provider`.
2. **Initialize a `Client` object:** Creates an instance of the `Client` class, specifying the `provider` as `Reka`.
3. **Prepare a chat message:** Creates a message object with the role "user" and content asking "What can you see in the image?".
4. **Send image and message to the Reca model:** Uses the `client.chat.completions.create()` method to send the message and the image to the "reka-core" model. 
5. **Process the response:** Iterates through the `completion` object, printing the textual description of the image provided by the Reca model.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from g4f.client import Client
from g4f.Provider import Reka

client = Client(
    provider = Reka # Optional if you set model name to reka-core
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model = "reka-core",
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What can you see in the image ?"
        }
    ],
    stream = True,
    image = open("docs/images/cat.jpeg", "rb") # open("path", "rb"), do not use .read(), etc. it must be a file object
)

for message in completion:
    print(message.choices[0].delta.content or "")

# >>> In the image there is ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
