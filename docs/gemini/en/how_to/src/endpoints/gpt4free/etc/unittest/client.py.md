**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block is a set of unit tests for the GPT-4 Free API client. It checks the functionality of the `AsyncClient` and `Client` classes, ensuring correct interactions with the API and data processing. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: It initializes an `AsyncClient` or `Client` object with a mock provider to simulate API responses.
2. **Request Generation**: The tests create chat completion requests with various parameters, including user messages, model names, max tokens, and stop conditions.
3. **Response Validation**:  The tests verify that the response from the `create` method is of the expected type, `ChatCompletion`, and that its content and structure are as anticipated.
4. **Stream Handling**:  Tests for streaming responses validate the correct structure and content of individual chunks received from the `create` method with `stream=True`.
5. **Exception Handling**: The tests include scenarios that test for potential errors, such as `ModelNotFoundError`, ensuring appropriate error handling.
6. **Model and Provider Retrieval**:  Tests for `get_model_and_provider` function validate the correct identification and selection of the model and provider based on the provided model name.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
import unittest
from g4f.client import Client, AsyncClient
from g4f.models import gpt_4o

# Create a client object
client = Client(model=gpt_4o.name)  # Use a specific model

# Send a chat completion request
response = client.chat.completions.create(messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello'}], 
                                        max_tokens=10, 
                                        stop=["\n"])

# Process the response
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
