**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block tests the functionality of various GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models available through the `g4f` library. It attempts to generate a poem about a tree using each model and logs whether the model works or throws an exception.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** Imports `asyncio`, `sys`, `pathlib`, `g4f`, and defines a `test` function.
2. **Define `test` function:** This function takes a `g4f.Model` as input and attempts to use it to generate a poem.
    - It tries both synchronous (`g4f.ChatCompletion.create`) and asynchronous (`g4f.ChatCompletion.create_async`) methods to handle the model's availability.
    - If successful, it prints the generated poem and returns `True`.
    - If an exception occurs, it logs the model name, error message, and traceback, then returns `False`.
3. **Define `start_test` function:** This function iterates through a list of pre-defined GPT models (`gpt_35_turbo` and `gpt_4`).
    - For each model, it calls the `test` function.
    - If `test` returns `True`, it appends the model name to a list of working models.
    - Finally, it prints the list of working models.
4. **Run the test:** Calls `asyncio.run(start_test())` to execute the `start_test` function asynchronously.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # This code block is a standalone example, so no modification needed.
    # You can run it directly to execute the tests.

    # Alternatively, you can adapt the `models_to_test` list to test
    # other GPT models available through the `g4f` library.
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
