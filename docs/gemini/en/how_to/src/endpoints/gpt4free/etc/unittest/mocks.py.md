**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a set of mock classes that mimic the behavior of different providers used within the project. The mock classes are intended for testing purposes and allow developers to simulate various scenarios without relying on actual external services or APIs.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Define Mock Classes:** The code defines several mock classes that inherit from the `AbstractProvider`, `AsyncProvider`, or `AsyncGeneratorProvider` classes. Each mock class is designed to simulate a specific provider type.
2. **Implement Mock Methods:** Each mock class implements a `create_completion`, `create_async`, or `create_async_generator` method. These methods are overridden to return specific mock responses or raise exceptions as needed for testing purposes.
3. **Use Mock Classes:**  During testing, these mock classes can be used to replace real provider instances, allowing developers to control the responses and ensure that the code interacts correctly with different provider scenarios.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.etc.unittest.mocks import ProviderMock

# Create an instance of the ProviderMock class
mock_provider = ProviderMock()

# Call a method on the mock provider
response = mock_provider.create_completion(model="test_model", messages=[], stream=False)

# Check the response
assert response == "Mock"
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
