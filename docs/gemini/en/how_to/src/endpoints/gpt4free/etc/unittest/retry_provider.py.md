**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block tests the `IterListProvider` class, which is used to iterate through a list of providers in order to find one that successfully generates a response. The tests cover different scenarios, including:

- Skipping providers that raise exceptions.
- Handling providers that return `None` as a result.
- Stream response processing for asynchronous providers.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Create an AsyncClient with an IterListProvider:** The tests initialize an `AsyncClient` object with an `IterListProvider` instance, providing a list of mock providers. 
2. **Call the create method:** The `create` method is called on the client's `chat.completions` object, passing in the messages and other parameters for generating a response. 
3. **Assert the response:** The tests assert that the response is of the expected type and contains the expected content based on the mock providers.
4. **Stream Response (if applicable):** For tests that involve streaming, the `create` method is called with `stream=True`. The `async for` loop iterates through the stream response chunks, asserting that each chunk has the expected content.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from g4f.client import AsyncClient
from g4f.providers.retry_provider import IterListProvider

# Create a list of providers
providers = [
    # Example providers (replace with actual providers)
    # ...
]

# Create an AsyncClient with the IterListProvider
client = AsyncClient(provider=IterListProvider(providers))

# Generate a response
response = await client.chat.completions.create(messages, "")

# Process the response
# ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
