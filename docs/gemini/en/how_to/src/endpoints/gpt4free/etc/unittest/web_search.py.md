**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet defines a unit test class named `TestIterListProvider` that verifies the functionality of the `search_tool` in the GPT-4 Free API. It checks if the `search_tool` successfully retrieves web search results and incorporates them into the chatbot's response. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The test class initializes an `AsyncClient` object using a mock provider (`YieldProviderMock`).
2. It defines a `tool_calls` list containing a single `search_tool` call with specific arguments, including the search query, maximum results, maximum words, and backend.
3. It attempts to send a chat completion request using the `client.chat.completions.create()` method.
4. The test asserts that the response from the `search_tool` includes a statement indicating that web search results were used.
5. If the `search_tool` encounters a `DuckDuckGoSearchException`, the test skips and logs the exception message.
6. The `test_search2` method demonstrates a simplified version of the `search_tool` call, omitting some arguments.
7. The `test_search3` method shows how to pass the arguments for the `search_tool` call as a JSON string.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from g4f.client import AsyncClient
from .mocks import YieldProviderMock

# Create an AsyncClient with a mock provider
client = AsyncClient(provider=YieldProviderMock)

# Define the tool calls
tool_calls = [
    {
        "function": {
            "arguments": {
                "query": "search query",  # content of last message: messages[-1]["content"]
                "max_results": 5,        # maximum number of search results
                "max_words": 500,        # maximum number of used words from search results
                "backend": "html",        # or "lite", "api": change it to pypass rate limits
                "add_text": True,         # do scraping websites
                "timeout": 5,             # in seconds for scraping websites
                "region": "wt-wt",
                "instructions": "Using the provided web search results, to write a comprehensive reply to the user request.\n"
                                    "Make sure to add the sources of cites using [[Number]](Url) notation after the reference. Example: [[0]](http://google.com)",
            },
            "name": "search_tool"
        },
        "type": "function"
    }
]

# Send a chat completion request
response = await client.chat.completions.create([{"content": "", "role": "user"}], "", tool_calls=tool_calls)

# Check if the response includes a statement indicating web search results were used
assert "Using the provided web search results" in response.choices[0].message.content
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
