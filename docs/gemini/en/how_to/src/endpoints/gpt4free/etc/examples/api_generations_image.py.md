**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: This code snippet generates an image using the GPT4Free API. It constructs a request body with the desired model, prompt, and response format, then sends a POST request to the API endpoint. The response is printed as JSON data.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:

    **Description**:  This code snippet demonstrates how to use the GPT4Free API to generate an image based on a given text prompt. 

    **Execution Steps**:
    1. **Import the `requests` library**: This library is used to send HTTP requests.
    2. **Define the API endpoint URL**:  This is the URL for the image generation endpoint on the GPT4Free API.
    3. **Construct the request body**: This includes the desired model, prompt, and response format. 
    4. **Send a POST request**: Use `requests.post` to send the request body to the API endpoint.
    5. **Receive and parse the response**: The API returns a JSON response, which is parsed and printed to the console.

    **Usage Example**:

    ```python
    import requests

    # Define the API endpoint URL
    url = "http://localhost:1337/v1/images/generations"

    # Construct the request body
    body = {
        "model": "flux",  # The model to use for image generation
        "prompt": "hello world user",  # The text prompt for image generation
        "response_format": None  # Specifies the format of the response. 'url' returns a URL, 'b64_json' returns the image as Base64 encoded data. 
    }

    # Send the POST request
    data = requests.post(url, json=body, stream=True).json()

    # Print the response data
    print(data)
    ```

3. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
