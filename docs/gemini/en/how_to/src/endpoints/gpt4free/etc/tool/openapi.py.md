**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block generates an OpenAPI specification file for the GPT4Free application. It utilizes the `create_app` function from the `g4f.api` module to create an application instance and then serializes the OpenAPI schema of the application using `app.openapi()`. The generated JSON data is then written to a file named `openapi.json`.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code begins by importing the `json` module for JSON serialization and the `create_app` function from the `g4f.api` module.
2. **Create application instance:** The `create_app` function is called to create an instance of the GPT4Free application. This instance represents the application's structure and functionality.
3. **Generate OpenAPI schema:** The `app.openapi()` method is called on the application instance to retrieve its OpenAPI schema. The schema defines the structure and functionality of the application's API endpoints, including the available methods, parameters, responses, and security schemes.
4. **Serialize and write to file:** The OpenAPI schema is then serialized into a JSON string using `json.dumps()` and written to a file named `openapi.json`.
5. **Print file size:** The code prints the size of the generated `openapi.json` file in kilobytes.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Import necessary modules
    import json
    from g4f.api import create_app

    # Create application instance
    app = create_app()

    # Generate OpenAPI schema and write to file
    with open("openapi.json", "w") as f:
        data = json.dumps(app.openapi())
        f.write(data)

    # Print file size
    print(f"openapi.json - {round(len(data)/1024, 2)} kbytes")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
