**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the `ConversationHandler` Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `ConversationHandler` class is a tool for managing conversations with a large language model (LLM), like GPT-4. It stores the conversation history, allows you to add user messages, and retrieves responses from the LLM. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the `ConversationHandler`**: 
   - Create an instance of the `ConversationHandler` class, specifying the desired LLM model (defaults to "gpt-4").
   - This initializes the conversation history as an empty list.

2. **Add User Messages**:
   - Use the `add_user_message` method to add user input to the conversation history.
   - The method appends a dictionary containing the "role" (user) and the "content" of the message to the `conversation_history` list.

3. **Retrieve Responses**:
   - Use the `get_response` method to get a response from the LLM based on the current conversation history.
   - The method:
     - Sends the conversation history to the LLM using the `g4f.client` library.
     - Extracts the LLM's response from the API results.
     - Appends the LLM's response to the `conversation_history`.
     - Returns the content of the LLM's response as a string. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Initialize the ConversationHandler
conversation = ConversationHandler()

# Add user messages
conversation.add_user_message("Hello!")
print("Assistant:", conversation.get_response())

conversation.add_user_message("How are you?")
print("Assistant:", conversation.get_response())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
