**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block retrieves information about available models from the Vercel AI platform. It scrapes the website's HTML to extract model names, IDs, and default parameters. It then formats this information into a structured dictionary and prints it for use in the project.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Retrieving Model Information**: The code first fetches the HTML content of the Vercel AI SDK website. It then uses regular expressions to find specific JavaScript code blocks containing model information. 
2. **Extracting Model Data**:  The script extracts model names, IDs, and default parameters from the JavaScript code using regular expressions.
3. **Formatting Model Information**: The code transforms the extracted data into a structured dictionary, where each model is represented by its name, ID, and default parameters.
4. **Printing Model Information**: The script prints the formatted model information as a JSON string for further use in the project.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    model_info = get_model_info()
    model_info = convert_model_info(model_info)
    print(json.dumps(model_info, indent=2))

    model_names = get_model_names(model_info)
    print("-------" * 40)
    print_providers(model_names)
    print("-------" * 40)
    print_convert(model_names)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
