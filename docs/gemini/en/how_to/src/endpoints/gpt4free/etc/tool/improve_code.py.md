**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet takes a Python code file as input and uses the GPT-4Free API to generate a improved version of the code, adding type hints if possible. It reads the code from the file, formats it for the API, and then sends the request to the GPT-4Free API. The response is then parsed and the improved code is written back to the file.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports necessary modules and sets up the path to the GPT-4Free library.
2. It defines a function `read_code` that extracts code from a text string based on the presence of ```python``` delimiters.
3. It prompts the user for the path to the code file.
4. It opens the file and reads the code content.
5. It constructs a prompt for the GPT-4Free API, including the code and instructions to improve it.
6. It sends the prompt to the GPT-4Free API, streaming the response.
7. The response is parsed and the improved code is extracted using the `read_code` function.
8. The improved code is written back to the file.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Example Usage
    path = "my_code.py"  # Replace with your code file path

    # Run the code snippet
    # ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
