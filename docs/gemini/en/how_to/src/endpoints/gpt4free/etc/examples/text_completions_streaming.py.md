**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code demonstrates two approaches to streaming text completions from the GPT-4 model using the `g4f` library. It provides synchronous and asynchronous streaming options, allowing users to receive and display responses incrementally.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import Libraries**: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries: `asyncio` for asynchronous operations and `Client` and `AsyncClient` from the `g4f` library to interact with the GPT-4 API.
2. **Define a Question**: A question is defined as a string, representing the input for the GPT-4 model.
3. **Synchronous Streaming Function (`sync_stream`)**:
    - Creates a synchronous `Client` object from the `g4f` library.
    - Sends a chat completion request to the GPT-4 model using the `create` method with `stream=True`.
    - Iterates through the stream of responses (chunks) and prints the content of each chunk incrementally.
4. **Asynchronous Streaming Function (`async_stream`)**:
    - Creates an asynchronous `AsyncClient` object from the `g4f` library.
    - Sends a chat completion request to the GPT-4 model using the `create` method with `stream=True`.
    - Uses an asynchronous `for` loop to iterate through the stream of responses (chunks) and print the content of each chunk incrementally.
5. **Main Function (`main`)**:
    - Calls the `sync_stream` function to execute the synchronous streaming process.
    - Calls the `asyncio.run(async_stream())` function to run the asynchronous streaming process.
6. **Error Handling**:
    - The `try...except` block handles potential errors during the process and prints an error message if an exception occurs.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.etc.examples.text_completions_streaming import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
