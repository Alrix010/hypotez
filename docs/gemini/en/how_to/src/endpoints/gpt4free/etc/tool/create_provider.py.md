**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block provides a tool to generate a Python class representing a provider for the `g4f` library based on a cURL command. It interacts with the user to gather the cURL command, provider class name, and then uses the `g4f.ChatCompletion.create` function with the `gpt_4o` model to generate the Python code for the provider.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **User Input**: Prompts the user for the following information:
    - **Provider Class Name**: The name of the class representing the provider.
    - **cURL Command**: The cURL command that the provider should interact with. 
2. **Example Provider**: The script presents an example Python provider class as a reference.
3. **Code Generation**:  
    - Constructs a prompt for the `gpt_4o` model based on the user input. 
    - Uses `g4f.ChatCompletion.create` to generate the Python code for the provider based on the prompt.
    - Prints the generated code to the console.
4. **File Saving**:
    - If the code is successfully generated:
        - Saves the generated code to a file named `g4f/Provider/<provider_name>.py`.
        - Adds an import statement for the new provider to the `g4f/Provider/__init__.py` file.
5. **Existing Provider Handling**: If a provider file with the given name already exists, the script reads the existing code from the file and presents it to the user.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Example usage
# In the terminal, run the script and follow the prompts:
# 1. Enter a provider name (e.g., "MyProvider")
# 2. Enter/Paste the cURL command (e.g., "curl -X POST https://example.com/api/completion -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"prompt\":\"Hello World!\", \"model\":\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"}'")
# The script will generate and save a provider file named "g4f/Provider/MyProvider.py".
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
