**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block demonstrates how to interact with the OpenAI API, specifically the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, to generate text. It sets up the API key and base URL, then sends a message requesting a poem about a tree. The response is either received in a stream (tokens) or as a complete dictionary. The code handles both scenarios and prints the generated text.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import the OpenAI library:** The code begins by importing the `openai` library.
2. **Set API key and base URL:** It defines the API key and base URL for the OpenAI API.
3. **Define the `main` function:** The main function contains the logic for interacting with the OpenAI API.
4. **Create a chat completion:** It uses the `openai.ChatCompletion.create` function to create a chat completion object. This object represents the conversation with the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.
5. **Send a message:** The `messages` argument is a list of dictionaries, each representing a message in the conversation. Here, a single message is sent with the role "user" and the content "write a poem about a tree".
6. **Handle stream response:** If the `chat_completion` object is a dictionary, it means the response was not streamed. The code then prints the generated text from the `choices` field.
7. **Handle streamed response:** If the `chat_completion` object is a generator, it means the response is streamed in tokens. The code iterates through the tokens and prints the content of each token.
8. **Run the main function:** The code calls the `main` function to initiate the interaction with the OpenAI API.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
import openai

# Set API key and base URL (replace with your own credentials)
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
openai.api_base = "YOUR_API_BASE_URL"

# Create a chat completion object
chat_completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "write a story about a cat"}],
    stream=True,
)

# Handle the response
for token in chat_completion:
    content = token["choices"][0]["delta"].get("content")
    if content:
        print(content, end="", flush=True)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
