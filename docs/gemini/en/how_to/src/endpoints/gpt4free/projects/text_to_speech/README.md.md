**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet provides a reference to a GitHub repository that serves as a starting point for developing a text-to-speech client.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code provides a link to the `transformers.js` repository on GitHub.
2. The link points specifically to the `examples/text-to-speech-client` directory.
3. This directory contains example code for building a text-to-speech client using the `transformers.js` library.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Example usage
from transformers import pipeline
from transformers.pipelines import TextToSpeechPipeline

# Instantiate a text-to-speech pipeline
tts_pipeline = TextToSpeechPipeline(model="espnet/kan-bayashi_ljspeech_fastspeech2_train_pytorch_transformer")

# Generate speech from text
speech = tts_pipeline("Hello, world!")

# Play the generated audio
speech.play()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
