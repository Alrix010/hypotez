**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code defines a class `Vitalentum` that interacts with the Vitalentum API to perform conversational AI requests. It uses `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code initializes an asynchronous HTTP session (`ClientSession`) with specific headers for API communication.
2. It prepares the request data, including the conversation history in JSON format and other optional parameters like temperature.
3. It sends a POST request to the Vitalentum API endpoint `/api/converse-edge`.
4. The code iterates through the response content, which is a stream of JSON data, and processes each line.
5. If the line starts with "data:", it extracts the content from the JSON and yields it. This allows the code to stream the response as it is received.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.Vitalentum import Vitalentum

    async def main():
        model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
        messages = [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am doing well, thank you!"}
        ]

        async for response_chunk in Vitalentum.create_async_generator(model, messages):
            print(f"Response chunk: {response_chunk}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import asyncio
        asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
