**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code snippet defines a `Koala` class, which is an asynchronous generator-based provider for interacting with the Koala.sh API. The class implements `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and `ProviderModelMixin` interfaces, providing methods for asynchronous generation of responses based on the provided messages and model.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `Koala` class initializes its attributes, including the base URL for the Koala.sh API and the default model used for generating responses.
2. **`create_async_generator`**: The class method `create_async_generator` takes model, messages, proxy, and connector as input and returns an asynchronous generator.
    - **Model Selection**: If no model is provided, it defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`.
    - **Headers**: The method constructs headers for the API request, including user agent, accept, referrer, and other relevant information.
    - **Request Data**: It prepares the request data, including the user input, message history (both user and assistant messages), and the selected model.
    - **API Call**: It makes a POST request to the Koala.sh API endpoint with the constructed data.
    - **Response Handling**: It handles the response from the API, using `raise_for_status` to raise an error if the response status code is not successful. It then iterates over the response content (event stream) using `_parse_event_stream` and yields each chunk to the calling function.
3. **`_parse_event_stream`**: This static method parses the event stream response from the Koala.sh API, extracting each data chunk and yielding it as a JSON object.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.not_working.Koala import Koala

async def main():
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello there!"},
    ]

    provider = Koala()
    async for chunk in provider.create_async_generator(model='gpt-4o-mini', messages=messages):
        print(f"Chunk: {chunk}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
