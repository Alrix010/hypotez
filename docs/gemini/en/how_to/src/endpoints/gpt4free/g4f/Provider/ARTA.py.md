**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block implements the `ARTA` class, which serves as a provider for image generation using the AI-ARTA API. This class provides methods for authentication, image generation, and status checking, allowing users to interact with the AI-ARTA service.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Authentication**:
   - The `read_and_refresh_token` method retrieves an authentication token from a local file. If the token is expired or not found, it generates a new token using the AI-ARTA API.

2. **Image Generation**:
   - The `create_async_generator` method takes user input, such as the image prompt, model, and generation parameters.
   - It then sends a POST request to the AI-ARTA image generation endpoint, including the authentication token, prompt, and other parameters.
   - The method returns an asynchronous generator that yields progress updates and the final image URLs.

3. **Status Checking**:
   - The `create_async_generator` method periodically checks the status of the image generation task using the AI-ARTA status checking endpoint.
   - It yields progress updates based on the status, such as "Waiting" or "Generating".
   - Once the generation is complete, it yields the final image URLs and returns.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.ARTA import ARTA

    # Initialize the ARTA provider
    arta_provider = ARTA()

    # Generate an image with a specific prompt and model
    async def generate_image():
        async for result in arta_provider.create_async_generator(
            model="Flux",
            prompt="A photorealistic image of a cat sitting on a window sill",
            n=1,
            guidance_scale=7,
            num_inference_steps=30,
        ):
            if isinstance(result, Reasoning):
                print(f"Reasoning: {result.label}")
            elif isinstance(result, ImageResponse):
                print(f"Generated image URLs: {result.images}")

    # Run the image generation process
    asyncio.run(generate_image())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
