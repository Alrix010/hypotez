**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code snippet implements a `FreeNetfly` class, which acts as a provider for the GPT-4 Free service. This provider enables the generation of text by interacting with the `free.netfly.top` API. The `FreeNetfly` class handles communication, response processing, and retry mechanisms to deliver text completions based on user input. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** The class initializes essential parameters like the base URL (`url`), API endpoint (`api_endpoint`), model list (`models`), and default model (`default_model`).
2. **Async Generator Creation:** The `create_async_generator` method is responsible for generating text completions asynchronously.
    -  **Headers and Data:** It prepares headers for the API request, including accept, language, content type, user-agent, etc. 
    -  **Payload Construction:** The method constructs the payload for the API call, including messages, model, temperature, and other parameters.
    -  **Retry Mechanism:** The method implements a retry mechanism with a maximum number of retries (`max_retries`) and exponential backoff.
3. **API Request:**  The `create_async_generator` method makes a POST request to the API endpoint.
4. **Response Processing:** The `_process_response` method handles the streamed response from the API, parsing JSON data and yielding text chunks.
    -  **JSON Parsing:** The method iterates through the response lines, decodes them, and parses the JSON content.
    -  **Text Extraction:** It extracts the `content` from the parsed JSON data and yields it as a chunk.
    -  **Error Handling:**  The code handles potential errors during JSON parsing and provides informative logging. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.not_working.FreeNetfly import FreeNetfly

async def generate_text():
    """Example of generating text using the FreeNetfly provider."""
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
    ]
    async for chunk in FreeNetfly.create_async_generator(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages):
        print(chunk, end="")

asyncio.run(generate_text())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
