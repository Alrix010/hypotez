**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a class `EasyChat` that implements the `AbstractProvider` interface, providing functionality for interacting with the EasyChat API. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The class defines various attributes:
    - `url`: Sets the base URL for the EasyChat API.
    - `supports_stream`: Indicates whether the provider supports streaming responses.
    - `supports_gpt_35_turbo`: Indicates whether the provider supports the GPT-3.5 turbo model.
    - `working`: A flag indicating whether the provider is currently functioning.

2. The `create_completion` method implements the core logic for sending requests to the EasyChat API.
    - It receives parameters for the model to use, the messages to send, and whether to stream the response.
    - It defines a list of potential API server URLs for the EasyChat service.
    - It randomly selects a server from the list.
    - It constructs the necessary headers for the HTTP request, including various security and user agent information.
    - It creates a JSON payload containing the request parameters.
    - It initiates a session with the EasyChat API.
    - It sends a POST request to the EasyChat API endpoint `/api/openai/v1/chat/completions` with the constructed headers and JSON data.
    - It handles the response from the server. If the response status code is not 200 (OK), it raises an exception.
    - If streaming is not enabled, it parses the response JSON and yields the content from the first response choice.
    - If streaming is enabled, it iterates over the response lines, parsing and yielding the content of each chunk.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.EasyChat import EasyChat

    # Create an instance of the EasyChat provider
    easychat_provider = EasyChat()

    # Define messages for the chat
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    ]

    # Generate a completion using the EasyChat provider
    for chunk in easychat_provider.create_completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages, stream=True):
        print(chunk)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
