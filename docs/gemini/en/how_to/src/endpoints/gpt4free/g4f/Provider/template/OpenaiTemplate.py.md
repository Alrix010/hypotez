**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `OpenaiTemplate` class is a provider for the OpenAI API. It provides methods for interacting with the API and generating text, images, and other responses. This class is a subclass of `AsyncGeneratorProvider`, which provides the capability of generating results asynchronously. The `create_async_generator` method allows you to send a request to the OpenAI API and receive a stream of results. The class also implements the `ProviderModelMixin` interface, which provides methods for retrieving and managing model information.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initializes API Settings:**
    - Defines API base URL, API key, API endpoint, and other settings for communication with the OpenAI API.
2. **Retrieves Available Models:**
    - The `get_models` method fetches a list of available models from the OpenAI API.
3. **Creates Asynchronous Generator:**
    - The `create_async_generator` method initiates an asynchronous request to the OpenAI API.
    - It takes various parameters, such as `model`, `messages`, `media`, `api_key`, `api_endpoint`, and other options to customize the request.
    - If the `model` is an image model, it formats the prompt for image generation.
4. **Sends Request and Processes Response:**
    - It sends a POST request to the appropriate API endpoint, depending on the model type and parameters.
    - It processes the response based on the `content-type`, handling JSON and streaming responses.
    - For image generation, it retrieves the image URLs from the response.
    - For text generation, it yields text chunks, tool calls, usage information, and finish reason.
5. **Handles Errors:**
    - Raises `MissingAuthError` if `api_key` is missing.
    - Raises `ResponseError` for unsupported content-types.
6. **Provides Model Management:**
    - The `get_model` method handles retrieving the appropriate model based on the provided `model` and `api_base`.
    - It ensures that the model is valid and accessible.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.template.OpenaiTemplate import OpenaiTemplate

# Initialize the provider with your API key
provider = OpenaiTemplate(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Define the prompt and messages
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
]

# Create an asynchronous generator
async_generator = await provider.create_async_generator(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages)

# Iterate over the results
async for response in async_generator:
    print(response)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
