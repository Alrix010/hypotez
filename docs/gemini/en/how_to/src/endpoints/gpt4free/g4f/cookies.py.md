**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code provides functionality for loading and managing cookies for different domains, specifically for accessing GPT-4 based AI services. It aims to:

- **Load Cookies from Browsers**: Attempts to read cookies from various browsers installed on the system.
- **Cache Cookies**: Stores loaded cookies for later retrieval to avoid redundant loading.
- **Read Cookie Files**: Loads cookies from specific files (`.har` and `.json`) that contain cookies.
- **Set Cookies**: Provides a mechanism to manually set or clear cookies for a given domain.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**:
    - Imports necessary modules and defines constants.
    - Checks for required packages (browser_cookie3 and platformdirs) and defines lists of browsers to attempt cookie loading from.
    - Defines a `CookiesConfig` class for managing cookies.
    - Defines a list `DOMAINS` containing domain names of interest (AI service domains).

2. **Get Cookies**:
    - `get_cookies(domain_name, raise_requirements_error, single_browser, cache_result)`:
        - Checks if cookies for the specified domain are already cached.
        - If not, calls `load_cookies_from_browsers` to load cookies.
        - Caches the loaded cookies if `cache_result` is True.
        - Returns the loaded cookies.

3. **Load Cookies from Browsers**:
    - `load_cookies_from_browsers(domain_name, raise_requirements_error, single_browser)`:
        - Checks if the browser_cookie3 package is installed.
        - Iterates over a list of browsers, attempting to read cookies from each using browser-specific functions (chrome, firefox, etc.).
        - If a cookie is found, checks its expiration date and adds it to the cookie dictionary if it is not expired.
        - If `single_browser` is True, stops after the first successful cookie read.
        - Returns the collected cookies.

4. **Set Cookies**:
    - `set_cookies(domain_name, cookies)`:
        - If cookies are provided, updates the cached cookies for the specified domain.
        - If no cookies are provided and the domain exists in the cache, removes cookies for that domain.

5. **Read Cookie Files**:
    - `read_cookie_files(dirPath)`:
        - Reads cookies from .har and .json files in a specified directory.
        - Extracts cookies from the files based on their structure and adds them to the `CookiesConfig.cookies` dictionary.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f import cookies

# Get cookies for "chatgpt.com"
cookies_dict = cookies.get_cookies("chatgpt.com")

# Print the cookies
print(cookies_dict)

# Set cookies for "google.com"
custom_cookies = {
    "cookie1": "value1",
    "cookie2": "value2"
}
cookies.set_cookies("google.com", cookies=custom_cookies)

# Read cookies from files in a specific directory
cookies.set_cookies_dir("./my_cookies_dir")
cookies.read_cookie_files()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
