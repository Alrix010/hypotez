**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines classes representing various response types from GPT-4Free API, handling different data formats and their presentation.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Response Types**: Defines abstract `ResponseType` base class for response handling.
2. **Mixin Classes**: Introduces `JsonMixin` to provide common JSON-related functionality (conversion to dict, attribute resetting).
3. **Specific Response Types**: Defines various response types:
    - `RawResponse`: Raw JSON response.
    - `HiddenResponse`: Represents responses hidden from the user, returning an empty string.
    - `FinishReason`: Provides a reason for the conversation's end.
    - `ToolCalls`: Represents a list of tool calls made during the conversation.
    - `Usage`: Represents usage information of the conversation.
    - `AuthResult`: Represents the result of authentication.
    - `TitleGeneration`: Contains a generated title.
    - `DebugResponse`: Provides a debug log message.
    - `Reasoning`: Represents the reasoning process of the conversation.
    - `Sources`: Represents a list of sources used in the conversation.
    - `YouTube`: Represents a list of YouTube IDs.
    - `AudioResponse`: Contains audio data, which can be converted to a data URI.
    - `BaseConversation`: Provides basic conversation handling.
    - `JsonConversation`: Represents a conversation in JSON format.
    - `SynthesizeData`: Contains data related to synthesized responses.
    - `SuggestedFollowups`: Holds a list of suggested follow-ups.
    - `RequestLogin`: Represents a request for user login.
    - `MediaResponse`: Base class for media responses (images and videos).
    - `ImageResponse`: Represents a response containing images.
    - `VideoResponse`: Represents a response containing videos.
    - `ImagePreview`: Represents a preview image.
    - `PreviewResponse`: Represents a preview response.
    - `Parameters`: Represents parameters passed to the API.
    - `ProviderInfo`: Provides information about the API provider.

Usage Example
-------------------------
```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.providers.response import ImageResponse, AudioResponse

# Example: Image Response
images = ["https://example.com/image1.jpg", "https://example.com/image2.png"]
alt_text = "Example images"
image_response = ImageResponse(images, alt_text)
print(image_response)  # Output: Markdown formatted images

# Example: Audio Response
audio_data = b'...'  # Audio data in bytes
audio_response = AudioResponse(audio_data)
print(audio_response)  # Output: HTML audio element
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
