**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `AiService` class implements the `AbstractProvider` interface, providing a basic implementation for interacting with an AI service. It handles the generation of completions using the provided `messages` and `model` parameters.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `create_completion` static method receives `model`, `messages`, `stream`, and optional keyword arguments (`kwargs`).
2. It constructs a request body by concatenating the messages into a single string.
3. It prepares the headers for the HTTP request.
4. It sends a POST request to the AI service endpoint (`https://aiservice.vercel.app/api/chat/answer`) with the constructed request body and headers.
5. The code checks for the response status code and raises an exception if it's not successful.
6. The code iterates through the JSON response and yields the 'data' part of the response.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.AiService import AiService

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am doing well, thank you for asking."},
]
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Create a completion using the AiService
completion = AiService.create_completion(model, messages, stream=False)

# Get the generated response
for response in completion:
    print(response)

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
