**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block defines two classes: `StreamResponse` and `StreamSession`.  `StreamResponse` is a wrapper class for asynchronous streaming responses from HTTP requests. `StreamSession` is an asynchronous session class for handling HTTP requests with streaming capabilities. This provides a mechanism for dealing with responses that are too large to fit in memory.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries**: The code imports relevant libraries, including `AsyncSession` and `Response` from the `curl_cffi.requests` module. It also attempts to import `CurlMime` and `CurlWsFlag`, which are related to multipart forms and websockets, respectively.
2. **Define `StreamResponse` class**: This class wraps the `Response` object from `curl_cffi.requests` and provides asynchronous methods for handling streaming responses.
   - `text()`: Asynchronously retrieves the response text.
   - `raise_for_status()`: Raises an HTTPError if one occurred.
   - `json()`: Asynchronously parses the JSON response content.
   - `iter_lines()`: Asynchronously iterates over lines of the response.
   - `iter_content()`: Asynchronously iterates over chunks of the response content.
   - `sse()`: Asynchronously iterates over Server-Sent Events of the response.
   - `__aenter__()`: Enters a runtime context for the response object.
   - `__aexit__()`: Exits the runtime context and closes the response connection.
3. **Define `StreamSession` class**: This class inherits from `AsyncSession` and provides methods for making HTTP requests with streaming capabilities.
   - `request()`: Creates a `StreamResponse` object for the given HTTP request.
   - `ws_connect()`: Connects to a websocket endpoint.
   - `_ws_connect()`: Private method for websocket connection (inherits from parent class).
   - `head()`, `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()`, `delete()`, `options()`: Partial methods providing direct access to standard HTTP methods with streaming.
4. **Define `FormData` class**: This class provides functionality for handling multipart forms (if `CurlMime` is available).
5. **Define `WebSocket` class**: This class represents a websocket connection and provides methods for receiving and sending data.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.requests.curl_cffi import StreamSession

async def main():
    async with StreamSession() as session:
        response = await session.get("https://example.com/large_file")
        # Process the streaming response
        async for chunk in response.iter_content():
            # Do something with each chunk
            print(chunk)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
