**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a class `Qwen_Qwen_2_5` that implements an asynchronous generator provider for interacting with the Qwen Qwen-2.5 model hosted on Hugging Face Spaces. It allows generating text asynchronously using the model and supports features like streaming responses and system messages.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The class initializes key properties like the model's label, URL, API endpoint, and supported features.
2. **Async Generator Creation**: The `create_async_generator` method is responsible for creating an asynchronous generator that handles the communication with the Qwen Qwen-2.5 model. It performs the following actions:
    - **Generate Session Hash**: A unique session hash is generated using `uuid.uuid4()` to identify the interaction.
    - **Prepare Headers and Payload**: The code prepares HTTP headers and a JSON payload containing the prompt, system message, and session hash.
    - **Send Join Request**: An HTTP POST request is sent to the model's API endpoint (`/queue/join`) to join the queue for processing the request.
    - **Send Data Stream Request**: An HTTP GET request is sent to the `/queue/data` endpoint with the session hash to receive the generated response as a stream.
    - **Process Response**: The code processes the streaming response, extracting text fragments as they become available and yields them. It handles both string and dictionary formats for the response.
    - **Check for Completion**: The code checks for completion messages from the model (`process_completed`) and yields the final response text when the generation is finished.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.hf_space.Qwen_Qwen_2_5 import Qwen_Qwen_2_5
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.typing import Messages

# Example messages
messages: Messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
]

# Create a Qwen_Qwen_2_5 provider instance
provider = Qwen_Qwen_2_5()

# Get the asynchronous generator
async_generator = await provider.create_async_generator(model="qwen-2.5", messages=messages)

# Iterate through the generated response stream
async for fragment in async_generator:
    print(fragment, end="")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
