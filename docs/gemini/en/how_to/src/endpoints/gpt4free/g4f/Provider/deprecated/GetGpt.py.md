**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block implements a class `GetGpt` that extends the `AbstractProvider` class, providing a mechanism to interact with the GetGPT.world API for generating text.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `create_completion` method sends a request to the GetGPT.world API with the provided user prompt, model parameters, and other settings.
2. The API response is received in a streaming format.
3. The code iterates through the streamed response, extracting and yielding each generated text chunk.
4. The `_encrypt` method is responsible for encrypting the request data (currently a placeholder and not implemented).

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.GetGpt import GetGpt

# Initialize the GetGPT provider
gpt_provider = GetGpt()

# Define the user prompt
user_prompt = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?"}
]

# Generate the response (in streaming format)
response = gpt_provider.create_completion(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
    messages=user_prompt, 
    stream=True
)

# Print the generated text chunks
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
