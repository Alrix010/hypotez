**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code defines a `Aibn` class that inherits from `AsyncGeneratorProvider`. This class represents an asynchronous provider for generating responses using the `Aibn` API. It supports message history and GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `create_async_generator` class method is responsible for initiating the asynchronous generation process. It takes the model name, messages, proxy (optional), timeout (optional), and keyword arguments.
2. It creates a `StreamSession` instance, which is a specialized session for handling asynchronous requests. It sets impersonation to "chrome107", applies the provided proxy, and sets a timeout.
3. It generates a timestamp, constructs a request body containing the messages, a `pass` value (set to None), a signature generated using the `generate_signature` function, and the timestamp.
4. It sends a POST request to the `Aibn` API endpoint `/api/generate` with the constructed request body.
5. It checks for errors in the response using `response.raise_for_status()`.
6. It iterates through the response content chunks and yields each decoded chunk as a string.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.Aibn import Aibn

# Define the messages to be sent to the API
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
]

# Initialize an Aibn provider
provider = Aibn()

# Start the asynchronous generation process
async_result = await provider.create_async_generator(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
    messages=messages
)

# Iterate over the response chunks
async for chunk in async_result:
    print(chunk)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
