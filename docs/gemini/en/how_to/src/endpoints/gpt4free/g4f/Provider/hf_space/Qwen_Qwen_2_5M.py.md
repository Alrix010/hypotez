**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block implements the `Qwen_Qwen_2_5M` class, which provides access to the Qwen-2.5-1m model via the Hugging Face Spaces API. It uses an asynchronous generator to stream responses from the model, allowing for real-time interaction and efficient resource utilization. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**:
   - The class inherits from `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and `ProviderModelMixin`, which provide base functionality for asynchronous generation and model management.
   - The `url` attribute stores the base URL for the Hugging Face Spaces API.
   - The `api_endpoint` attribute constructs the endpoint for sending prediction requests.
   - The `working` attribute indicates if the provider is currently operational.
   - The `supports_stream`, `supports_system_message`, and `supports_message_history` attributes define the capabilities of the model.
   - The `default_model` attribute specifies the default model to use.
   - The `model_aliases` attribute defines alternate model names and their mapping to the default model.
   - The `models` attribute lists all supported model names.

2. **Asynchronous Generator**:
   - The `create_async_generator` method is responsible for creating an asynchronous generator that streams responses from the model.
   - It generates a unique session hash for the request.
   - It formats the input `messages` into a prompt suitable for the model.
   - It prepares the headers for the API request.
   - It constructs the payload for the prediction request, including the prompt, event data, and session hash.
   - It establishes an asynchronous HTTP session using `aiohttp`.
   - It sends a POST request to the Hugging Face Spaces API endpoint with the prepared payload.
   - It retrieves the response data as JSON.

3. **Data Stream Processing**:
   - It sends a POST request to the `join_url` to join the data stream.
   - It extracts the event ID from the response.
   - It constructs the URL for the data stream.
   - It prepares headers for the data stream request.
   - It sends a GET request to the data stream URL.
   - It iterates through the data stream using `async for`.
   - It parses the JSON data from each line of the stream.
   - It checks for specific message types (e.g., `process_generating`, `process_completed`).
   - It yields intermediate responses for each message type, enabling streaming.
   - It handles potential JSON decoding errors.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.hf_space import Qwen_Qwen_2_5M
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.helper import format_prompt
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.response import Messages

# Create an instance of the Qwen_Qwen_2_5M provider
provider = Qwen_Qwen_2_5M()

# Prepare input messages
messages = Messages(
    [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
    ]
)

# Use the async generator to stream the response
async for response in provider.create_async_generator(messages):
    print(response.content)

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
