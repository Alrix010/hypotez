**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a comprehensive list of AI models supported by the project, along with their associated providers and configurations. It utilizes a dataclass `Model` to represent each model and its properties: name, base provider, and best provider. The `best_provider` attribute often utilizes an `IterListProvider` to cycle through multiple providers for optimal results.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Model Definition**: The code defines various AI models as `Model` instances, setting the model's name, base provider (default provider), and best provider.
2. **Provider Selection**: For `best_provider`, the code often uses an `IterListProvider` which contains a list of providers to cycle through for optimal results.
3. **Model Mapping**: The `ModelUtils` class creates a dictionary mapping model names to their corresponding `Model` instances.
4. **Model and Provider Listing**: The `__models__` dictionary is generated by iterating through all `Model` instances and extracting their name, associated `Model` object, and a list of working providers.
5. **Model Name List**: The `_all_models` list is created by extracting the keys (model names) from the `__models__` dictionary.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.models import ModelUtils, Model

# Get a model instance by name
model = ModelUtils.convert['gpt-4']

# Access model attributes
print(f"Model name: {model.name}")
print(f"Base provider: {model.base_provider}")
print(f"Best provider: {model.best_provider}")

# Iterate through providers in best_provider (if it's an IterListProvider)
if isinstance(model.best_provider, IterListProvider):
    for provider in model.best_provider.providers:
        print(f"Provider: {provider.name}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
