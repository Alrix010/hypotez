**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

## How to Use the `RetryProvider` Class

=========================================================================================

### Description

The `RetryProvider` class provides a mechanism to retry requests to multiple providers, allowing for redundancy and resilience. It takes a list of provider classes and offers options for shuffling the provider order and retrying individual providers multiple times.

### Execution Steps

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create an instance of `RetryProvider`, passing in a list of provider classes to use.
    - Optionally, set `shuffle` to `True` to shuffle the provider order, `single_provider_retry` to `True` to retry a single provider if it fails, and `max_retries` to specify the maximum number of retries for a single provider.

2. **Requesting a Completion**:
    - Call the `create_completion` method with the desired model, messages, and optional arguments.
    - The method iterates through the providers, attempting to generate a completion. 
    - If a provider succeeds, the returned completion is yielded and the process ends.
    - If a provider fails, the exception is yielded, and the process continues to the next provider.
    - If all providers fail, a combined exception is raised.

3. **Asynchronous Requests**:
    - The `create_async_generator` method allows for asynchronous requests, working similarly to `create_completion` but using asynchronous operations. 

4. **Error Handling**:
    - The `raise_exceptions` function is used to raise a combined exception if any provider encounters an error during retries. 

### Usage Example

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.providers import RetryProvider, OpenAIProvider, GPT4FreeProvider

providers = [OpenAIProvider, GPT4FreeProvider]
retry_provider = RetryProvider(providers, shuffle=True, single_provider_retry=True, max_retries=3)

model = "text-davinci-003"
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
]

# Request a completion with retries
for chunk in retry_provider.create_completion(model, messages, stream=True):
    if isinstance(chunk, str):
        print(chunk)
