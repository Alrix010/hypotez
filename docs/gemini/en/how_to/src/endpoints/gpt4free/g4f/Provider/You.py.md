**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block implements the `You` class, which provides an asynchronous generator-based interface for interacting with You.com's large language models (LLMs). The class inherits from `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and `ProviderModelMixin` to handle asynchronous responses and model management. The code defines various methods for generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The class initializes various properties like `label`, `url`, `working`, `default_model`, `image_models`, `models`, `_cookies`, `_cookies_used`, and `_telemetry_ids`.
2. **Asynchronous Generator Creation**: The `create_async_generator` class method creates an asynchronous generator that streams responses from the You.com API.
3. **Model and Chat Mode Selection**: The method determines the appropriate model and chat mode based on the user's input, such as choosing the default model or a specific vision model.
4. **Cookie Management**: If necessary, the code retrieves cookies from the user's browser or retrieves new cookies through a headless browser interaction.
5. **Asynchronous Session**: The code uses an asynchronous session (`StreamSession`) to make requests to the You.com API.
6. **Image Upload**: If an image is provided, the code uploads the image to the You.com API.
7. **API Request**: The code constructs a request to the You.com API with the provided parameters, including the prompt, model, chat mode, and cookies.
8. **Response Handling**: The code iterates through the streaming response from the API and yields the generated text, image previews, or image responses as appropriate.
9. **File Upload**: The `upload_file` class method handles the upload of files to the You.com API.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.You import You
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.typing import Messages

    # Create an asynchronous generator
    async_generator = await You.create_async_generator(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
        ]
    )

    # Iterate through the responses
    async for response in async_generator:
        print(response)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
