**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block implements a fake GPT-based language model using the `FakeGpt` class, which inherits from `AsyncGeneratorProvider`. It utilizes an external API endpoint and simulates responses, providing an alternative to real GPT models.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**:
   - The `FakeGpt` class initializes the necessary variables and attributes, including the URL of the API endpoint (`url`), model support (`supports_gpt_35_turbo`), working state (`working`), access token (`_access_token`), and cookie jar (`_cookie_jar`).

2. **Asynchronous Generator Creation**:
   - The `create_async_generator` method asynchronously generates responses, simulating interactions with a GPT model.

3. **API Interaction**:
   - The method establishes a connection to the API endpoint using `ClientSession` and performs API calls:
     - **Login**: If the access token is not available, it retrieves a token from the API and stores it.
     - **Request**: It sends a request to the API endpoint with user input (messages), including the `parent_message_id` and the `model` parameter.

4. **Response Processing**:
   - The method receives responses from the API and streams them in a line-by-line fashion.
   - It parses the responses, extracts the content, and yields each new message incrementally.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The code handles potential errors during the process and raises a `RuntimeError` if no valid response is received.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.FakeGpt import FakeGpt

async def main():
    provider = FakeGpt()
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
    ]
    async for response in provider.create_async_generator(model="text-davinci-002-render-sha", messages=messages):
        print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
