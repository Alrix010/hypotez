**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a `AIModel` class, which represents a GPT-4Free (G4F) model. The `AIModel` class inherits from `OpenAIModel` and uses the G4F API to interact with AI models.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports necessary libraries and initializes constants from `pydantic_ai` and `..client`.
2. It defines a `AIModel` dataclass which inherits from `OpenAIModel`. This class is used to represent a G4F model.
3. The `AIModel` class has a constructor that initializes the model name, provider, system prompt role, and system attributes.
4. The `name` method of the `AIModel` class returns the name of the model, including the provider if it's specified.
5. The `new_infer_model` function is defined to infer the correct model type based on the input model name.
6. The `patch_infer_model` function patches the `infer_model` function from `pydantic_ai.models` to use the `new_infer_model` function for G4F model inference.
7. This patch replaces the `AIModel` from `pydantic_ai` with the `AIModel` defined in this code block.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.integration.pydantic_ai import AIModel

# Initialize an AI model using G4F
model = AIModel(model_name="text-davinci-003", provider="gpt4free", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Use the model for generating text
response = model.generate(text="This is a test.")

# Print the generated response
print(response)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
