**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a class `Website` which is responsible for routing requests to different pages of a web application. The `Website` class uses Flask to manage the routes. It has a `routes` dictionary where each key represents a URL path and each value is a dictionary with a `function` (the view function to handle the request) and `methods` (HTTP methods allowed for this route).

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the Website class**: 
    - The `Website` class is initialized with a Flask application object.
    - The class defines the routes and corresponding view functions.
2. **Define routes**: 
    - Each route is defined as a key-value pair in the `routes` dictionary.
    - The key is the URL path, and the value is another dictionary with `function` and `methods` keys.
3. **Define view functions**: 
    - The view functions are defined separately and referenced by name in the `routes` dictionary.
    - The `redirect_home()` function redirects the user to the home page ( `/chat`).
    - The `_chat()` function handles requests to the chat page, rendering the `index.html` template with a unique conversation ID.
    - The `_share_id()` function handles requests to the share page, rendering the `index.html` template with a unique conversation ID and other parameters.
    - The `_index()` function handles requests to the home page, rendering the `index.html` template with a unique conversation ID.
    - The `_settings()` function handles requests to the settings page, rendering the `index.html` template with a unique conversation ID.
    - The `_background()` function handles requests to the background page, rendering the `background.html` template.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.gui.server.website import Website
from flask import Flask

# Create a Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize the Website class
website = Website(app)

# Add routes from the Website class
for route, route_data in website.routes.items():
    app.add_url_rule(route, view_func=route_data['function'], methods=route_data['methods'])

# Run the Flask app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
