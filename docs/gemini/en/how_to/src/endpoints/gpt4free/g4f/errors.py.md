**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a set of custom exceptions specific to the GPT4Free API integration. These exceptions are designed to indicate different types of errors that can occur during interactions with the GPT4Free API.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Define Custom Exceptions**: The code defines custom exception classes, each representing a specific error scenario during API interaction. 
2. **Error Handling**: These exceptions are intended to be raised when errors occur during API calls, providing specific context for the error.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
try:
    # Code that interacts with GPT4Free API
    response = gpt4free_api.send_request(message)

except ProviderNotFoundError:
    print("The requested provider was not found.")

except ProviderNotWorkingError:
    print("The selected provider is not currently working.")

except ResponseError:
    print("An error occurred during the API request.")

except TimeoutError:
    print("The API request timed out.")

except ConversationLimitError:
    print("The conversation limit has been reached.")

    # Handle other custom exceptions as needed...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
