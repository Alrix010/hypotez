**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block implements the `Backend_Api` class, which handles various backend API endpoints in a Flask application. It provides methods for interacting with models, providers, and managing functionalities like conversations, error handling, and version management. The class sets up routes for different endpoints, including those for fetching models, providers, handling conversations, managing files, and serving images.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the `Backend_Api` object with a Flask application instance. It also sets up default routes for the home page, QR code generation, and API endpoints for models, providers, and conversations.
2. **Model and Provider Handling**: The `jsonify_models`, `jsonify_provider_models`, and `jsonify_providers` methods handle requests to retrieve information about models and providers, returning the data in a JSON format.
3. **Conversation Handling**: The `handle_conversation` method processes requests for conversations, handling media uploads and selecting providers based on the requested model. It then creates a stream to send the conversation response back to the client.
4. **Usage and Log Tracking**: The `add_usage` and `add_log` methods handle logging of usage statistics and user interactions.
5. **Memory Management**: The `add_memory` and `read_memory` methods implement interactions with a memory client (presumably using a service like `mem0`) for storing and retrieving conversation history.
6. **Version Management**: The `get_version` method provides the current version of the API.
7. **Synthesize Handling**: The `handle_synthesize` method handles requests for synthesizing content using providers.
8. **Image and Media Serving**: The `serve_images` method serves images and other media files from specified locations.
9. **File Management**: The `manage_files` and `upload_files` methods provide functionalities for creating, deleting, and uploading files to buckets.
10. **Cookie Upload**: The `upload_cookies` method allows users to upload cookies for use in subsequent requests.
11. **Chat Data Management**: The `get_chat` and `upload_chat` methods manage chat data, providing functionality for retrieving and updating chat histories.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.gui.server.backend_api import Backend_Api

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Backend_Api(app)

# Example of getting a list of models
@app.route('/get_models')
def get_models():
    response = api.get_models()
    return jsonify(response)

# Example of handling a conversation request
@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    json_data = request.get_json()
    response = api.handle_conversation(json_data)
    return response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
