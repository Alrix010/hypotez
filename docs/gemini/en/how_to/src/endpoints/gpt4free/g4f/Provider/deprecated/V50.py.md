How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code implements a class called `V50` which represents a deprecated API provider for GPT models. It uses a static method `create_completion` to send a request to the provider's API endpoint, allowing the user to generate text completions.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The code creates an instance of the `V50` class.
2. **Model Selection**: The `create_completion` method is called, specifying the model, messages, and stream parameters. 
3. **Request Preparation**: The code builds a payload dictionary with the provided arguments and assembles a dictionary of headers for the API request.
4. **API Call**: The code sends a POST request to the `https://p5.v50.ltd/api/chat-process` endpoint using the prepared payload and headers.
5. **Response Handling**: The code checks for a specific string in the response text to determine if the request was successful. If the string is not present, the response text is yielded as a generator.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.V50 import V50

provider = V50()
model = "text-davinci-003"  # Replace with desired model
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
]
response = provider.create_completion(model, messages, stream=False)

# Iterate through the generator to get the response text
for part in response:
    print(part)
```
