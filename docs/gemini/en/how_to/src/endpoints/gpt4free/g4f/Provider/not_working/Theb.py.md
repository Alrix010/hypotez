**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a `Theb` class that represents a provider for the TheB.AI platform, which allows interactions with large language models (LLMs). The class implements the `AbstractProvider` interface, providing methods to create completions (responses) from LLMs.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `Theb` class is initialized with the provider's label, URL, working status, and supported features (streaming).
2. **Model Selection**: The `create_completion` method allows users to select a specific LLM model from a predefined list.
3. **Prompt Formatting**: The input prompt is formatted using the `format_prompt` helper function.
4. **Webdriver Session**: A `WebDriverSession` object is created to manage the interaction with the TheB.AI website using Selenium.
5. **Script Injection**: A JavaScript script is injected into the web page to intercept the `fetch` API calls and stream the response from the LLM.
6. **Navigation and Model Selection**: The webdriver navigates to the TheB.AI website and waits for specific elements to load, including the text area and model selection panel.
7. **Model Selection**: The desired LLM model is selected from the model selection panel.
8. **Prompt Submission**: The formatted prompt is submitted to the TheB.AI platform.
9. **Response Reading**: The script intercepts the streamed response from the LLM and yields chunks of the response.
10. **Response Streaming**: The `create_completion` method yields chunks of the response to the caller, allowing for streaming of the LLM output.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.not_working.Theb import Theb

# Instantiate Theb provider
provider = Theb()

# Create a completion using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model with streaming enabled
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
]
for chunk in provider.create_completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages, stream=True):
    print(chunk)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
