**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a class `NoowAi` that provides a method for interacting with the NoowAi API. It inherits from the base class `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and uses asynchronous programming to handle the communication with the API. The class supports message history and GPT 3.5 turbo models.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Create an Asynchronous Generator**: The `create_async_generator` class method is used to create an asynchronous generator that will yield responses from the NoowAi API. It takes several arguments:
    - `model`: The desired model to use for the API request.
    - `messages`: A list of messages representing the conversation history.
    - `proxy`: An optional proxy to use for the API request.
2. **Set up HTTP Headers**: The code sets up a dictionary of HTTP headers that will be sent with the API request. These headers include information about the user agent, accept type, language, encoding, referrer, and content type.
3. **Create an HTTP Session**: An asynchronous HTTP session is created using the `aiohttp` library.
4. **Prepare Request Data**: A dictionary of data is prepared for the API request, including the bot ID, custom ID, session ID, chat ID, context ID, messages, new message, and stream flag.
5. **Send API Request**: The `session.post` method is used to send a POST request to the NoowAi API endpoint `/wp-json/mwai-ui/v1/chats/submit`.
6. **Process API Response**: The code iterates through the response lines, extracting JSON data and yielding responses to the asynchronous generator.
    - `live` responses are yielded as is.
    - `end` responses signal the end of the conversation.
    - `error` responses raise a `RuntimeError` exception.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.NoowAi import NoowAi

async def main():
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
    ]
    async for response in NoowAi.create_async_generator(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages):
        print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
