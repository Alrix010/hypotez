**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block implements the `GeekGpt` class, which is a provider for the `gpt4free` endpoint. It inherits from the `AbstractProvider` class and provides functionality for making API requests to the GeekGpt service for generating text completions.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `create_completion` class method is called with arguments specifying the model, messages, and stream parameters.
2. If no model is specified, the default `gpt-3.5-turbo` model is used.
3. A JSON payload is constructed, containing the messages, model, and other parameters like temperature, presence penalty, top_p, and frequency penalty.
4. The JSON payload is converted to a string using `dumps`.
5. A `POST` request is made to the GeekGpt API endpoint (`https://ai.fakeopen.com/v1/chat/completions`) with the constructed JSON payload and appropriate headers.
6. The response is iterated over line by line to extract the generated text.
7. If the line contains "content," the JSON data is extracted and the content is yielded, making the method a generator that yields text chunks.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.GeekGpt import GeekGpt
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.typing import Messages

    messages: Messages = [
        {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, world!'},
    ]

    provider = GeekGpt()
    for chunk in provider.create_completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages, stream=True):
        print(chunk, end="")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
