**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a class `Qwen_QVQ_72B` which implements a provider for the Qwen QVQ-72B model from Hugging Face. This provider allows users to interact with the model through a specific API endpoint. It handles the communication with the model and returns responses as an asynchronous generator.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the Provider**:  The code defines class attributes like `label`, `url`, `api_endpoint`, which are used to identify and interact with the model.
2. **Create an Asynchronous Generator**: The `create_async_generator` method handles the communication with the model. It sets headers for authorization and content type, constructs a request, and sends it to the API endpoint. 
3. **Process the Response**: It receives the response and processes it. The response is parsed, and if it contains errors, it raises a `ResponseError`. If the response is complete, it yields the response to the user. If the response is still being generated, it yields the currently available text and continues to receive more text from the response.
4. **Return the Generated Text**: The `create_async_generator` method returns an asynchronous generator, allowing users to receive text responses in chunks.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.hf_space.Qwen_QVQ_72B import Qwen_QVQ_72B

async def main():
    provider = Qwen_QVQ_72B()
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
    async for response in provider.create_async_generator(model="qwen-qvq-72b-preview", messages=messages):
        print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
