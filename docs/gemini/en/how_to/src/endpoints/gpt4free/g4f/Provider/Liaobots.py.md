**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet defines the `Liaobots` class, which represents a provider for accessing and interacting with the Liaobots API. The class is responsible for handling model selection, sending chat requests, and receiving responses. It also includes authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the API.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Model Support Check**: The `is_supported` method checks if the given model is supported by the Liaobots provider.
2. **Async Generator Creation**: The `create_async_generator` method initializes an asynchronous generator that sends chat requests and receives responses from the Liaobots API. It first sets up a connection to the API using an `aiohttp` client session, then sends a POST request with the conversation ID, model, messages, and authentication information. The response stream is parsed line by line, and each line containing "data:" is processed to extract the generated content.
3. **Authentication Initialization**: The `initialize_auth_code` method retrieves an authentication code from the Liaobots API and sets it as a class attribute. 
4. **Authentication Enforcement**: The `ensure_auth_code` method verifies if an authentication code has already been initialized and, if not, calls the `initialize_auth_code` method to retrieve one.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.Liaobots import Liaobots

    async def main():
        provider = Liaobots()
        messages = [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
        ]
        async for response in provider.create_async_generator(model="gpt-4", messages=messages):
            print(response)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import asyncio
        asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
