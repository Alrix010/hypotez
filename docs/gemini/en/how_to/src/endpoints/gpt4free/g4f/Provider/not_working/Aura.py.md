**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet defines an `Aura` class that acts as a provider for generating responses from an AI model using the `openchat.team` API. It inherits from the `AsyncGeneratorProvider` base class and defines a `create_async_generator` method that asynchronously generates responses based on user input.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the `Aura` class:** The `Aura` class is initialized with the API endpoint URL `https://openchat.team`.
2. **Create an asynchronous generator:** The `create_async_generator` method is called to create an asynchronous generator that will generate responses.
3. **Prepare the request data:** The method takes several parameters, including the AI model to use (`model`), the user's messages (`messages`), optional proxy settings (`proxy`), temperature (`temperature`), maximum token limit (`max_tokens`), and a webdriver instance (`webdriver`).
4. **Extract arguments from the browser:** The `get_args_from_browser` function (not shown) is used to extract any necessary arguments from the browser environment.
5. **Create an asynchronous HTTP session:** An `aiohttp` ClientSession is created with the extracted arguments.
6. **Process the user messages:** The method iterates through the `messages` list and separates system messages from user messages.
7. **Prepare the request data:** A dictionary (`data`) is constructed with the necessary parameters for the API request, including the selected model, user messages, prompt, temperature, and token limit.
8. **Send the API request:** The `session.post` method sends a POST request to the `openchat.team` API endpoint with the prepared data.
9. **Handle the response:** The response is checked for errors, and the content is iterated over using an asynchronous iterator, yielding each decoded chunk of data.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.not_working.Aura import Aura
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.typing import Messages

# Initialize the Aura class
aura = Aura()

# Define the user messages
messages = Messages(
    [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?"},
    ]
)

# Create an asynchronous generator for responses
async_generator = await aura.create_async_generator(model="openchat_3.6", messages=messages)

# Process the generated responses
async for chunk in async_generator:
    print(chunk)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
