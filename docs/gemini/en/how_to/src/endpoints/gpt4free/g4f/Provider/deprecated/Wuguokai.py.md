**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code defines a `Wuguokai` class that implements the `AbstractProvider` interface. It provides a method `create_completion` that allows to generate text responses from a language model using the `Wuguokai` API. This API is used to send a prompt to a language model and get a response back.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code first imports necessary libraries like `requests`, `random`, and `typing`.
2. It defines the `Wuguokai` class, which inherits from `AbstractProvider`.
3. The class has a `create_completion` method, which is responsible for interacting with the `Wuguokai` API.
4. Inside the `create_completion` method, the code constructs a request body containing the prompt, user ID, and options.
5. It then sends a POST request to the API endpoint and processes the response.
6. The code splits the response text and yields the generated text.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.Wuguokai import Wuguokai

    provider = Wuguokai()

    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?"},
    ]
    
    for response in provider.create_completion(model="text-davinci-003", messages=messages, stream=False):
        print(response)

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
