**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block implements a class `Yqcloud` which is an asynchronous provider for generating responses using the `yqcloud` API.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a class `Yqcloud` that inherits from `AsyncGeneratorProvider`, which is a base class for asynchronous providers.
2. The class has a static method `create_async_generator` that generates responses asynchronously using the `yqcloud` API.
3. The method takes parameters like `model`, `messages`, `proxy`, `timeout`, and `kwargs`.
4. It uses a `StreamSession` to make a POST request to the API endpoint with the payload containing the prompt and other settings.
5. The method iterates over the response chunks and yields each chunk as a string.
6. It also includes error handling to detect potential issues like IP blockages.
7. Two helper functions `_create_header` and `_create_payload` are defined to create the header and payload for the API request.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.Yqcloud import Yqcloud
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.typing import Messages

    messages: Messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
    ]

    provider = Yqcloud()
    async for chunk in provider.create_async_generator(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages):
        print(chunk, end="")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
