**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `DfeHub` class provides an implementation for using the DfeHub API to generate text completions with GPT-3.5 Turbo model. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the provider**: Create an instance of the `DfeHub` class.
2. **Prepare the messages**: Create a list of dictionaries representing the conversation history. Each dictionary contains `role` (e.g., "user", "assistant") and `content` (the message text).
3. **Call `create_completion`**: Call the `create_completion` method to send a request to the DfeHub API. The method takes the following parameters:
    - `model`: The desired model (currently only "gpt-3.5-turbo" is supported).
    - `messages`: The list of conversation messages.
    - `stream`: Indicates whether to receive responses in stream mode (True).
    - `kwargs`: Additional parameters for the API request, such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `top_p`.
4. **Process the response**: The `create_completion` method returns a generator that yields chunks of the response from the DfeHub API. Each chunk is decoded from JSON and contains the generated text.
5. **Handle delays**: The code checks for potential delays in the response and pauses execution if necessary.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.DfeHub import DfeHub

# Initialize the provider
provider = DfeHub()

# Conversation messages
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How can I help you today?"},
]

# Call the API
for chunk in provider.create_completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages, stream=True):
    print(chunk)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
