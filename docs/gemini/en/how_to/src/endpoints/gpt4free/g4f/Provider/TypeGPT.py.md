**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a `TypeGPT` class that acts as a provider for OpenAI-like services, specifically utilizing the TypeGPT platform. It inherits from the `OpenaiTemplate` class and provides specific attributes and methods for interacting with the TypeGPT API.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `TypeGPT` class is initialized with default values for attributes like `url`, `api_base`, `working`, `headers`, and `default_model`. It also defines a list of supported models, including vision models, fallback models, and image models. 
2. **Model Aliases**: The `model_aliases` dictionary maps common model names to their actual names used by the TypeGPT API.
3. **`get_models` Method**: This class method retrieves a list of available models from the TypeGPT API. It first checks if the `models` attribute is empty. If so, it makes a GET request to the `/api/config` endpoint to fetch the model list. The model names are then parsed and filtered, removing any image models or models that don't start with a `+`.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.TypeGPT import TypeGPT

# Get the available models from TypeGPT
models = TypeGPT.get_models()

# Print the list of models
print(models)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
