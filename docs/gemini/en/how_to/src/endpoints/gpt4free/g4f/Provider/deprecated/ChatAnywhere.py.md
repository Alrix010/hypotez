**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code defines a class `ChatAnywhere` that inherits from `AsyncGeneratorProvider`. This class represents a chat provider with a specific URL (`https://chatanywhere.cn`) and supports features like GPT-3.5 Turbo and message history.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `ChatAnywhere` class is initialized with default values for URL, supported models, and other parameters.
2. **Async Generator Creation**: The `create_async_generator` class method is called to create an asynchronous generator for handling chat interactions. This method takes various parameters, including `model`, `messages`, `proxy`, `timeout`, `temperature`, and others.
3. **HTTP Request Setup**: Headers for the HTTP request are set up with appropriate values for User-Agent, Accept, Content-Type, Referer, Origin, and other relevant parameters.
4. **Async Session and Request**: An asynchronous session is created using `aiohttp` and a POST request is sent to the provider's API endpoint (`/v1/chat/gpt/`) with the specified data and headers.
5. **Response Handling**: The code checks for a successful response (status code 200) and iterates through the response content chunks to yield decoded chunks of data.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.ChatAnywhere import ChatAnywhere

async def chat_with_chatanywhere(messages: Messages):
    """
    Sends a chat request to ChatAnywhere and handles the response asynchronously.
    """
    async for chunk in ChatAnywhere.create_async_generator(model='gpt-3.5-turbo', messages=messages):
        print(chunk)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
