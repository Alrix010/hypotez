**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a function `create_app` that creates a Flask application instance. It handles the setup of template and static folders based on whether the application is running in a bundled or development environment. It also enables auto reloading in debug mode.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Check for Bundled Environment**: The code first checks if the application is running in a bundled environment using `getattr(sys, 'frozen', False)`. This is a common way to detect if the application is running as a standalone executable.
2. **Set Template Folder**: If the application is bundled, the template folder is set to `os.path.join(sys._MEIPASS, "client")`. This assumes that the client templates are located in a subfolder named "client" within the bundled application. If the application is not bundled, the template folder is set to "../client", indicating a relative path to the client templates.
3. **Create Flask App**: The code creates a Flask application instance using `Flask(__name__, template_folder=template_folder, static_folder=f"{template_folder}/static")`. This initializes the application with the specified template and static folders.
4. **Enable Auto Reload**: The code sets the `TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD` configuration option to `True` to enable auto reloading in debug mode. This means that changes to templates will be automatically reflected in the application without requiring a server restart.
5. **Return Application**: The function returns the created Flask application instance.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.gui.server.app import create_app

app = create_app()

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
