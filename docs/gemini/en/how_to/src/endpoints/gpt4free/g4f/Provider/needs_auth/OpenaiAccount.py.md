**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `OpenaiAccount` class extends the `OpenaiChat` class and is used to represent an OpenAI account in the project. It inherits properties from `OpenaiChat` and adds specific attributes related to account authentication and usage.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Inheritance**: The `OpenaiAccount` class inherits from the `OpenaiChat` class, inheriting its properties and methods.
2. **Authentication Requirement**: The `needs_auth` attribute is set to `True`, indicating that this class requires authentication for usage.
3. **Parent Class**: The `parent` attribute is set to `"OpenaiChat"`, specifying the parent class from which it inherits.
4. **No Driver Usage**: The `use_nodriver` attribute is set to `False`, indicating that the model name should include "(Auth)" to denote authentication requirement.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.needs_auth.OpenaiAccount import OpenaiAccount

# Create an OpenaiAccount object
account = OpenaiAccount()

# Use the inherited methods from OpenaiChat
response = account.send_message("Hello, world!")

# Access the account-related properties
print(account.needs_auth) # Output: True
print(account.parent) # Output: "OpenaiChat"
print(account.use_nodriver) # Output: False
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
