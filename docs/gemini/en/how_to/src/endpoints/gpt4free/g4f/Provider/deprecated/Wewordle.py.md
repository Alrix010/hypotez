**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block defines a class `Wewordle` that implements the `AsyncProvider` interface. This class is designed to interact with a GPT-like service, potentially for text generation or other tasks. The `Wewordle` class contains a URL, a flag to indicate if it's currently working, and information about its support for specific models.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `create_async` class method initiates a request to a GPT-like service.
2. It constructs headers for the request, including "accept", "pragma", "Content-Type", and "Connection".
3. It generates a unique user ID and an app ID using random characters and digits.
4. It creates a request data structure that includes user details, messages, and subscription information.
5. It establishes an asynchronous HTTP session with the specified headers.
6. It sends a POST request to the GPT service's endpoint using the generated data and specified proxy settings.
7. It raises an exception if the request results in an error status code.
8. It extracts the content of the response message and returns it if available.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.Wewordle import Wewordle

async def main():
    model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Or any other supported model
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am doing well, thank you. How can I help you today?"},
    ]
    proxy = "http://your_proxy_server:port"  # Optional, use a proxy if needed

    try:
        response = await Wewordle.create_async(model, messages, proxy=proxy)
        print(f"GPT response: {response}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
