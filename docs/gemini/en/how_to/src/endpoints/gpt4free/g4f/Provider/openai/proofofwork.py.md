**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `generate_proof_token` function generates a proof token used for interacting with OpenAI's GPT-4 API. This token is required for authentication and ensures that the user is not a bot.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Check if a proof token is required.** If `required` is False, the function returns without generating a token.
2. **Generate a proof token if it's not provided.**  A random screen ID, current UTC time, and other random values are combined into a list to form the initial proof token. 
3. **Generate a hash and compare with the difficulty level.** For 100,000 iterations, a hash is generated using SHA3-512. The hash is calculated by combining a seed value (which is optional and can be used for custom requirements) and a base64 encoded version of the proof token. The first `diff_len` characters (where `diff_len` is the length of the `difficulty` string) of the hash are compared to the `difficulty` string. 
4. **Return the base64 encoded proof token if a match is found.** If the hash matches the difficulty level, the base64 encoded proof token is returned with a prefix of "gAAAAAB".
5. **Generate a fallback proof token.** If no match is found after 100,000 iterations, a fallback token is generated by base64 encoding the seed string.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    proof_token = generate_proof_token(required=True, seed='my_seed', difficulty='000000')
    print(proof_token)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
