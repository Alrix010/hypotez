**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines an asynchronous generator provider class `AiAsk` that allows you to send messages to the AiAsk API and receive responses using the `aiohttp` library.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the `AiAsk` Class**: The `AiAsk` class is initialized with the necessary parameters for the AiAsk API, including the base URL, support for message history and GPT-3.5 Turbo, and an indication of whether it's currently working.

2. **Create an Asynchronous Generator**: The `create_async_generator` method is used to create an asynchronous generator that yields responses from the AiAsk API.

3. **Send Request to AiAsk API**: The method sends a POST request to the AiAsk API endpoint using `aiohttp.ClientSession` with headers that include the API's origin and referer. The request body contains the message history, model selection, prompt, and other parameters.

4. **Process Responses in Chunks**: The response from the API is processed in chunks using an asynchronous generator (`response.content.iter_any()`). Each chunk is decoded, and the code checks if the response contains a rate limit error message. 

5. **Yield Responses**: If the response doesn't contain a rate limit error, it is yielded to the caller. 

6. **Handle Rate Limit Errors**: If a rate limit error is detected, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.AiAsk import AiAsk
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.typing import Messages

async def main():
    ai_ask = AiAsk()
    messages: Messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    ]
    async for response in ai_ask.create_async_generator(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages):
        print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
