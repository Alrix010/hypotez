**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `BackendApi` class is a provider that utilizes the `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and `ProviderModelMixin` base classes. It defines a `create_async_generator` method for handling asynchronous conversation interactions with a backend API. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Create an Asynchronous Generator:** The `create_async_generator` method is responsible for creating an asynchronous generator that interacts with the backend API. 
2. **Prepare Media Data:** If any media is provided (`media` parameter), the method converts it to data URI format for processing.
3. **Establish a Stream Session:** An asynchronous stream session is established using `StreamSession` with specific headers, including the "Accept" header for text/event-stream format.
4. **Send API Request:** A POST request is sent to the backend API endpoint `/backend-api/v2/conversation`. This request includes the model name, messages, media (if provided), and API key. 
5. **Iterate through Response:** The response from the API is processed line-by-line, and each line is interpreted as a JSON object, representing a raw response. 
6. **Yield Raw Responses:** Each parsed raw response is yielded by the generator, providing streaming results.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.template.BackendApi import BackendApi

async def main():
    # Example usage
    api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello! What is the meaning of life?"},
    ]

    async for response in BackendApi.create_async_generator(
        model=model, messages=messages, api_key=api_key
    ):
        print(f"Raw Response: {response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
