**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a `StreamSession` class that inherits from `ClientSession` and provides methods for handling streamed responses from a server. The class utilizes the `StreamResponse` subclass to handle the streamed content in a more efficient manner.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `StreamSession` class initializes the `ClientSession` with custom headers, timeout settings, and a custom `BaseConnector` for handling proxies if necessary.
2. The `get_connector` function handles setting up the `BaseConnector` if a proxy is provided. It uses `aiohttp_socks` library for handling SOCKS proxies.
3. The `StreamResponse` class overrides the `iter_lines`, `iter_content`, and `json` methods of the `ClientResponse` class. It allows for efficient handling of streamed content.
4. The `sse` method of the `StreamResponse` class provides an asynchronous generator that iterates through the Server-Sent Events (SSE) data.
5. The `sse` method checks each line in the response for a "data:" prefix and extracts the JSON data. If the data is "[DONE]", it breaks the loop, indicating the end of the SSE stream.
6. The `StreamSession` class uses the `StreamResponse` class as its default response type to ensure that the response handling is done using streamed data.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
import asyncio
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.requests.aiohttp import StreamSession

async def main():
    async with StreamSession(headers={"Authorization": "your_api_key"}) as session:
        async with session.get("https://example.com/sse") as response:
            async for data in response.sse():
                print(data)

asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
