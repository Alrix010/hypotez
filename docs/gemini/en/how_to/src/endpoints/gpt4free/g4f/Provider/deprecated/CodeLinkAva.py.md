**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a class called `CodeLinkAva` which is a provider for the "Ava" AI chatbot. This provider extends the `AsyncGeneratorProvider` class, which allows for asynchronous communication with the API. It makes HTTP requests to the Ava API to generate responses and returns an asynchronous generator that yields the generated text. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `CodeLinkAva` class defines its URL, a flag for whether it supports the "gpt-3.5-turbo" model, and a flag for whether it is currently working.
2. **Asynchronous Generator Creation**: The `create_async_generator` class method is called to create an asynchronous generator. This method takes the model name, list of messages, and optional keyword arguments.
3. **Setting Headers**: Headers for the HTTP request are defined, including user agent, accept types, origin, referer, and security related headers.
4. **Creating an HTTP Session**: An asynchronous HTTP session is created with the defined headers.
5. **Sending the Request**: An HTTP POST request is sent to the Ava API with the provided messages, temperature (for controlling the randomness of the output), and optional keyword arguments.
6. **Handling Response**: The response is checked for errors. If successful, the response is iterated line by line.
7. **Processing Lines**: Each line is decoded, and if it starts with "data:", the content is extracted and yielded.
8. **Ending the Generator**: When a "data: [DONE]" line is encountered, the generator stops.

Usage Example
-------------------------
```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.deprecated.CodeLinkAva import CodeLinkAva

async def main():
    provider = CodeLinkAva()
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"},
    ]
    async for response in provider.create_async_generator(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages):
        print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
