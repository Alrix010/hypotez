**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `raise_for_status` function checks the status of an HTTP response. If the response is not successful (status code is not 200), the function raises a `ResponseStatusError` with an error message extracted from the response content.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Check Response Status**: The function checks if the response's `ok` attribute is `True`. If it is, the function returns without raising an error.
2. **Extract Error Message**: If the response status is not successful, the function tries to extract an error message from the response content.  
    - If the response's content type is `application/json`, the function attempts to parse the response as JSON and extracts the `error` or `message` field.
    - If the content type is not `application/json`, the function extracts the response's text content.
3. **Raise ResponseStatusError**: If an error message is extracted, the function raises a `ResponseStatusError` with the extracted message and the response status code. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.hf_space.raise_for_status import raise_for_status
    from aiohttp import ClientResponse

    async def handle_response(response: ClientResponse):
        try:
            await raise_for_status(response) 
            # If no exception is raised, the response is successful
        except ResponseStatusError as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
