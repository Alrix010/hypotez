**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines the `TeachAnything` class, which is a provider for the GPT4Free API. It implements the `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and `ProviderModelMixin` interfaces. It uses the `aiohttp` library to make asynchronous requests to the Teach Anything API and provides a generator to stream the response from the API.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Class Definition**: The `TeachAnything` class is defined, inheriting from `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and `ProviderModelMixin`. This class represents a provider for the Teach Anything API.
2. **Class Attributes**:
   - `url`: The base URL for the Teach Anything API.
   - `api_endpoint`: The specific endpoint for generating text.
   - `working`: Flag indicating if the provider is currently working.
   - `default_model`: The default model for generating text.
   - `models`: List of supported models.
3. **`create_async_generator` Method**: This method is responsible for making requests to the Teach Anything API and returning a generator that streams the response.
    - **Prepare Request**: It formats the user prompt, sets up headers, and creates an `aiohttp` session.
    - **Send Request**: It makes a POST request to the Teach Anything API with the formatted prompt and necessary headers.
    - **Handle Response**: It handles the response by iterating through the chunks of data, decoding them, and yielding them as they become available.
    - **Error Handling**: It handles any decoding errors or exceptions that may occur during the process.
4. **`_get_headers` Method**: This static method returns a dictionary of headers used for making requests to the Teach Anything API.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider import TeachAnything

async def main():
    provider = TeachAnything()
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
    ]
    async for chunk in provider.create_async_generator(model='gemini-1.5-pro', messages=messages):
        print(chunk, end='')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
