**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block implements an `Api` class that handles the various API endpoints for GPT4Free, providing functionality to fetch information about available models, providers, versions, and managing conversations. It also handles media requests and responses, including image and video processing, as well as logging and error handling.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `Api` class is defined with static methods to retrieve information about models, providers, and versions.
2. The `get_models` method retrieves information about available models, including their name, image/vision capabilities, and supported providers.
3. The `get_provider_models` method fetches models available for a specific provider, including their default status, vision/image capabilities, and associated task (if any).
4. The `get_providers` method returns a list of available providers with their names, labels, capabilities (image/vision), authentication requirements, and login URLs.
5. The `get_version` method retrieves the current and latest versions of the GPT4Free application.
6. The `serve_images` method serves images from the designated directory.
7. The `_prepare_conversation_kwargs` method prepares keyword arguments for the `ChatCompletion.create` function, setting up parameters like model, provider, messages, and tool calls.
8. The `_create_response_stream` method handles asynchronous interactions with the chat model, iterating over responses and processing them based on their type (e.g., messages, images, videos, errors, etc.).
9. The `handle_provider` method formats the response from a provider, including model information if available.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.gui.server.api import Api

# Get available models
models = Api.get_models()
print(models)

# Get models for a specific provider
provider_models = Api.get_provider_models(provider="OpenAI", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
print(provider_models)

# Get information about available providers
providers = Api.get_providers()
print(providers)

# Get the current and latest versions of GPT4Free
version_info = Api.get_version()
print(version_info)

# Serve an image from the designated directory
api = Api()
image_path = "my_image.jpg"
api.serve_images(image_path)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
