**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines the `DeepseekAI_JanusPro7b` class, which is a provider for the DeepseekAI Janus-Pro-7B model. This provider allows users to interact with the model and perform various actions such as sending messages, generating images, and receiving responses. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines the `DeepseekAI_JanusPro7b` class, inheriting from `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and `ProviderModelMixin`, enabling asynchronous operations and model-related functionality.
2. It initializes the class attributes, including the `label`, `space`, `url`, `api_url`, `referer`, `working`, `supports_stream`, `supports_system_message`, `supports_message_history`, `default_model`, `default_image_model`, `default_vision_model`, `image_models`, `vision_models`, and `models`.
3. The `run` class method handles requests to the DeepseekAI API, allowing for different methods like "post" and "image", depending on the task.
4. The `create_async_generator` class method creates an asynchronous generator that handles communication with the model, allowing for streaming of responses and processing of images.
5. The `get_zerogpu_token` function retrieves the required token and session ID for accessing the DeepseekAI model.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.hf_space.DeepseekAI_JanusPro7b import DeepseekAI_JanusPro7b
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.base_provider import ProviderModelMixin

provider = DeepseekAI_JanusPro7b(model="janus-pro-7b")  # Instantiate the provider with the desired model
response = provider.run(prompt="Hello, how are you?")  # Send a prompt to the model
print(response)  # Print the received response

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
