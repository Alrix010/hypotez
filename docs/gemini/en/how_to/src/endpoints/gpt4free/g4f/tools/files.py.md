## How to Use This Code Block
========================================================================================

### Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a set of functions and utilities for handling files within the `hypotez` project. It provides functionalities for:

* **Secure Filename Handling**: The `secure_filename()` function ensures that filenames are sanitized for safe use within the project.
* **File Extension Support**: The `supports_filename()` function checks if a file extension is supported by the system, raising an exception if necessary libraries are missing.
* **File Bucket Management**: The `get_bucket_dir()` function creates a directory structure for storing files within the project. The `get_buckets()` function lists available file buckets.
* **Text Refinement with spaCy**: The `spacy_refine_chunks()` function utilizes spaCy for text refinement, separating text into chunks and removing stop words.
* **File Handling and Streaming**: Functions such as `get_filenames()`, `stream_read_files()`, `cache_stream()`, `read_bucket()`, and `stream_read_parts_and_refine()` handle reading and processing files of different types, including PDF, DOCX, ODT, EPUB, XLSX, HTML, and plain text files.
* **URL Downloading and Handling**: The `download_urls()` function downloads files from provided URLs, while `get_filename()`, `get_file_extension()`, and `read_links()` are utility functions for extracting filenames, extensions, and links from URLs.
* **Streaming and Events**: The `stream_chunks()` function provides a streaming mechanism for processing files, while `get_streaming()` and `get_async_streaming()` offer synchronous and asynchronous versions of the streaming functionality.

### Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize Libraries and Modules**: The code imports necessary libraries like `re`, `os`, `json`, `pathlib`, `aiohttp`, `urllib.parse`, `time`, `zipfile`, `asyncio`, `hashlib`, `base64`, and specific libraries for handling different file types, such as `pypdf2`, `pdfplumber`, `pdfminer`, `docx`, `docx2txt`, `odfpy`, `ebooklib`, `openpyxl`, `spacy`, and `beautifulsoup4`. 
2. **Define Utility Functions**: The code defines several utility functions for:
    * **Securing Filenames**: `secure_filename()` sanitizes filenames for safety.
    * **Checking File Extension Support**: `supports_filename()` determines if a file extension is supported.
    * **Getting File Bucket Directory**: `get_bucket_dir()` creates a directory for storing files.
    * **Getting Existing Buckets**: `get_buckets()` lists available file buckets.
3. **File Reading and Processing**: The code defines functions for reading and processing files:
    * **Reading Files in a Bucket**: `stream_read_files()` reads files from a specified bucket directory, handling different file types.
    * **Caching File Content**: `cache_stream()` caches file content to enhance performance.
    * **Reading Files Chunk by Chunk**: `read_path_chunked()` reads files in chunks for efficient processing.
    * **Reading a Bucket's Content**: `read_bucket()` reads content from a bucket directory.
    * **Refining File Content with spaCy**: `stream_read_parts_and_refine()` processes file content using spaCy for text refinement.
    * **Splitting Files into Chunks**: `split_file_by_size_and_newline()` splits a file into chunks based on size and newline characters.
4. **URL Downloading and Handling**: Functions are defined for downloading URLs and extracting relevant information:
    * **Extracting Filename from Response**: `get_filename()` attempts to determine the filename from an aiohttp response.
    * **Getting File Extension**: `get_file_extension()` determines the file extension from a response.
    * **Reading Links from HTML**: `read_links()` extracts links from HTML content.
5. **File Downloading and Streaming**: Functions are defined for downloading URLs and streaming files:
    * **Downloading URLs**: `download_urls()` downloads URLs asynchronously, handling various file types and ensuring safe filenames.
    * **Getting Download URLs**: `get_downloads_urls()` retrieves download URLs from a JSON file.
    * **Reading and Downloading URLs**: `read_and_download_urls()` and `async_read_and_download_urls()` read and download URLs, updating a file list and potentially providing event streaming.
    * **Streaming File Chunks**: `stream_chunks()` streams chunks of file data with optional text refinement using spaCy.
    * **Get Streaming Functions**: `get_streaming()` and `get_async_streaming()` provide synchronous and asynchronous versions of the file streaming functionality.

### Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.tools import files

# Example of secure filename handling
filename = "Example File.docx"
secure_filename = files.secure_filename(filename)
print(f"Secure filename: {secure_filename}")  # Output: Example_File.docx

# Example of checking file extension support
filename = "my_file.pdf"
if files.supports_filename(filename):
    print(f"File extension '{filename}' is supported.")
else:
    print(f"File extension '{filename}' is not supported.")

# Example of getting a file bucket directory
bucket_dir = files.get_bucket_dir("my_bucket")
print(f"File bucket directory: {bucket_dir}")

# Example of downloading URLs and streaming file content
bucket_dir = "path/to/my/bucket"
urls = ["https://example.com/file1.pdf", "https://example.com/file2.txt"]
for chunk in files.get_streaming(bucket_dir, delete_files=True):
    print(chunk)
```

This code demonstrates basic usage of the functions defined in the provided code block. You can explore and adapt these examples for your specific needs within the `hypotez` project.
