**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines the `Client` class, which handles initialization and proxy configuration for interacting with a GPT-4 Free API.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `Client` class is initialized, optionally accepting an API key and proxy configuration.
2. The `api_key` is stored internally for use in API requests.
3. The `proxies` argument is parsed to determine the proxy configuration:
    - If `proxies` is a string, it is directly assigned to the `proxy` attribute.
    - If `proxies` is a dictionary, it is used to determine the proxy based on the key (`"all"`, `"https"`).
    - If `proxies` is `None`, the `G4F_PROXY` environment variable is checked for a proxy.
4. The `get_proxy` method handles the logic of selecting the appropriate proxy based on the provided configuration.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.client.types import Client

# Initialize a Client instance with an API key
client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")

# Initialize a Client instance with a proxy string
client = Client(proxies="http://your_proxy_address")

# Initialize a Client instance with a proxy dictionary
client = Client(proxies={"https": "http://your_https_proxy_address"})

# Initialize a Client instance with a proxy from the environment variable
os.environ["G4F_PROXY"] = "http://your_proxy_address"
client = Client() 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
