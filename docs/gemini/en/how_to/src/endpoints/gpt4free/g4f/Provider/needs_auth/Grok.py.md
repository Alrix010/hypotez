**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Grok` class represents the Grok AI provider, which offers access to a large language model through an API. This class implements the necessary logic to interact with the Grok AI service, including authentication, model selection, and message generation.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Authentication**: The `on_auth_async` class method handles the authentication process with Grok AI. It retrieves cookies from the `get_cookies` function and initiates the login flow if necessary. Once authenticated, it returns an `AuthResult` object with the required cookies and headers for further API requests.

2. **Model Selection and Prompt Preparation**: The `_prepare_payload` class method constructs the payload for the API request, including the model name, prompt text, and other parameters. The `modelName` is set based on the chosen model, and the `isReasoning` flag is set to `True` if the model is a reasoning model (e.g., "grok-3-thinking").

3. **Message Generation**: The `create_authed` class method handles the generation of responses from the selected Grok AI model. It sends a POST request to the Grok API with the prepared payload, iterates over the response lines, and parses JSON data to extract results, including text, image previews, reasoning status, and generated images. The method also manages conversation states, returning a `Conversation` object if requested.

Usage Example
------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.needs_auth.Grok import Grok

async def main():
    # Authenticate with Grok AI.
    auth_result = await Grok.on_auth_async()
    if isinstance(auth_result, RequestLogin):
        print("Login required.")
        return
    # Select the Grok-3 model.
    model = "grok-3"
    # Prepare a message for the model.
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
    ]
    # Generate a response from the model.
    async for response in Grok.create_authed(model=model, messages=messages, auth_result=auth_result):
        if isinstance(response, str):
            print(f"Response: {response}")
        elif isinstance(response, ImagePreview):
            print(f"Image preview: {response.url}")
        elif isinstance(response, ImageResponse):
            for image in response.images:
                print(f"Generated image: {image}")
        elif isinstance(response, Reasoning):
            print(f"Reasoning status: {response.status}")
        elif isinstance(response, TitleGeneration):
            print(f"Generated title: {response.title}")
        elif isinstance(response, Conversation):
            print(f"Conversation ID: {response.conversation_id}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
