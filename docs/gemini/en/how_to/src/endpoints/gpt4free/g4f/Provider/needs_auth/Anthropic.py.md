**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block defines a `Anthropic` class that represents an Anthropic API provider. This class inherits from the `OpenaiAPI` class, providing similar functionality for interaction with the Anthropic API. It defines class attributes such as `label`, `url`, `login_url`, `working`, `api_base`, `needs_auth`, `supports_stream`, `supports_system_message`, `supports_message_history`, `default_model`, `models`, and `models_aliases`. The class also includes methods for fetching available models, generating responses from the API, and handling authentication. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Class Definition**: Defines the `Anthropic` class which inherits from `OpenaiAPI`.
2. **Class Attributes**: Sets various attributes related to the Anthropic API, including its label, URL, login URL, working status, API base URL, authentication requirements, stream support, system message support, message history support, default model, list of models, and aliases for models.
3. **`get_models` Method**: Fetches a list of available models from the Anthropic API. If the list of models is empty, it makes a request to the API endpoint to retrieve the models and updates the `models` attribute with the retrieved IDs.
4. **`create_async_generator` Method**: Creates an asynchronous generator that interacts with the Anthropic API to generate responses.
    - **Handles Authentication**: Ensures that an `api_key` is provided and raises an error if it's missing.
    - **Handles Media Input**: If media is provided, it converts images to base64 encoding and inserts them into the message content.
    - **Prepares System Message**: Extracts the system message from the provided messages.
    - **Sends Request**: Makes a POST request to the Anthropic API endpoint with the prepared request data.
    - **Parses Response**: Parses the response from the API and yields results, including text, tool calls, finish reasons, and usage information.
    - **Handles Stream Support**: If `stream` is enabled, it handles streamed responses, parsing chunks and yielding partial results.
5. **`get_headers` Method**: Constructs the headers for requests to the Anthropic API, including `Accept`, `Content-Type`, `x-api-key`, and `anthropic-version`.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.needs_auth.Anthropic import Anthropic

    # Initialize the Anthropic API provider
    anthropic_provider = Anthropic(api_key="your_anthropic_api_key")

    # Generate a response
    async for response in anthropic_provider.create_async_generator(
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?"}
        ],
    ):
        print(response)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
