**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block parses a OneTab URL and extracts the target URLs, a description, and a price (if available) from it. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Fetch the OneTab URL**: The function retrieves the HTML content of the provided OneTab URL using the `requests` library.
2. **Parse HTML**: BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content and extract data.
3. **Extract Target URLs**: The code finds all anchor tags with the class "tabLink" and extracts the "href" attribute from each, storing them as a list.
4. **Extract Description and Price**: 
    - The code locates the `div` element with class "tabGroupLabel" and extracts its text content.
    - If found, the text is split into price and description parts. The price is converted to an integer if it's a number.
    - If not found, the price is set to an empty string and the description is set to the current timestamp.
5. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple containing the price (string), description (string), and a list of extracted URLs.
6. **Handle Exceptions**:  The code handles `requests.exceptions.RequestException` errors, logging the error and returning False values for all components.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
one_tab_url = "https://onetab.com/page/YOUR_ONE_TAB_URL"
price, description, urls = fetch_target_urls_onetab(one_tab_url)
print(f"Price: {price}, Description: {description}, URLs: {urls}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
