**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet sets up and runs a Telegram bot using the Aiogram library. It includes:
  - Loading environment variables for the bot's token.
  - Initializing the `Dispatcher` object for handling bot commands.
  - Creating a `Bot` instance with the loaded token.
  - Adding a throttling middleware to prevent rate limiting.
  - Including the bot's router for handling commands and messages.
  - Starting the bot polling loop to listen for incoming updates.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Load environment variables**:
   - Loads environment variables from a `.env` file using `load_dotenv()`. This assumes the bot's token is stored in the `TOKEN` environment variable.
2. **Initialize Dispatcher**:
   - Creates an instance of the `Dispatcher` class, which will handle incoming updates and route them to the appropriate handlers.
3. **Create Bot Instance**:
   - Creates a `Bot` instance using the token retrieved from the environment variable. This instance is responsible for communicating with the Telegram API.
4. **Add Throttling Middleware**:
   - Registers the `ThrottlingMiddleware` to the `Dispatcher`. This middleware helps prevent the bot from being rate-limited by Telegram's API.
5. **Include Router**:
   - Includes the `router` (defined in the `apps.hendlers` module) into the `Dispatcher`. The router contains all the handlers for the bot's commands and messages.
6. **Start Polling Loop**:
   - Starts the bot polling loop using `dp.start_polling(bot)`. This continuously checks for new updates from Telegram and processes them using the handlers defined in the `router`.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Assuming you have a .env file with the following content:
# TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the dispatcher
dp = Dispatcher()

# ... (rest of the code from the example)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
