**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

## How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet generates an HTML string that represents the welcome message for the Toolbox Telegram bot. The message provides an overview of the bot's capabilities, including:

- Content generation for various tasks using neural network models.
- Creative brainstorming and concept suggestion.
- Image generation based on descriptions.
- Podcast, webinar, and video transcription.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code begins by defining an HTML `<h1>` tag with the text "Toolbox AI".
2. It then defines an `<h3>` tag with the text "ðŸ›  Welcome to Toolbox! This is a universal assistant that can generate content for various work tasks!".
3. The code proceeds to create several `<p>` tags to describe the bot's features and benefits. 
4. It uses bold tags (`<b>`) to highlight important information, such as the need to choose a task, provide input, and receive ready-made content.
5. Finally, the code includes a `P.S.` section to inform users about the free generation limit and available tariff plans.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# This code snippet is meant to be used within a Telegram bot's response message. 
# It is not meant to be executed as a standalone script. 

# Example of how to use the code snippet in a Telegram bot:
from telegram import Update, Bot
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler, MessageHandler, Filters

# ... (rest of the bot code)

def start(update: Update, context: CallbackContext):
    """
    Sends the welcome message when the user starts the bot.
