**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines various asynchronous functions that handle different HTTP requests for a web server. It includes:
- **`handle_webhook`**: Handles Telegram webhook updates, receiving incoming messages and updates from the Telegram bot.
- **`home_page`**: Renders a basic HTML page with information about the service, showcasing the ability of aiohttp to serve HTML content.
- **`robokassa_result`**: Processes responses from Robokassa, a payment gateway, verifying the payment signature and storing payment data in the database if successful.
- **`robokassa_fail`**: Handles unsuccessful payment attempts from Robokassa, logging the details and sending a simple HTML response.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **`handle_webhook`**:
    - Receives an HTTP request from Telegram's webhook.
    - Parses the request's JSON data into an `Update` object.
    - Feeds the `Update` object to the `dp` (dispatcher) to process the update.
    - Returns a 200 OK response to acknowledge receipt of the update.
2. **`home_page`**:
    - Generates an HTML page with information about the service.
    - Returns a 200 OK response with the HTML content.
3. **`robokassa_result`**:
    - Receives a response from Robokassa's ResultURL endpoint.
    - Extracts payment details from the request data, including the payment signature, amount, and user information.
    - Validates the payment signature using the `check_signature_result` function.
    - If the signature is valid:
        - Logs a success message and stores payment data in the database using `successful_payment_logic`.
    - If the signature is invalid:
        - Logs a warning message and returns a "bad sign" response.
4. **`robokassa_fail`**:
    - Receives a response from Robokassa's FailURL endpoint.
    - Extracts payment details from the request data.
    - Logs the failed payment information.
    - Returns a "Платеж не удался" (Payment failed) response.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Example usage of handle_webhook
    from aiohttp import web

    app = web.Application()
    app.add_routes([web.post('/webhook', handle_webhook)])

    web.run_app(app, port=8000)

    # Example usage of home_page
    from aiohttp import ClientSession

    async with ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('http://localhost:8000/') as response:
            print(response.text)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
