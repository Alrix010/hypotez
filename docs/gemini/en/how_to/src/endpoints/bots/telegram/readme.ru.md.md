**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines the `TelegramBot` class, which represents a Telegram bot and handles interactions with users, including commands, voice messages, and document files.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the bot with a token, registers handlers for commands and messages, and sets up the bot's dispatcher.
2. **Command Handlers**: The `start`, `help_command`, and `send_pdf` methods handle the `/start`, `/help`, and `/sendpdf` commands respectively.
3. **Message Handling**: The `handle_voice`, `handle_document`, and `handle_message` methods handle voice messages, document files, and text messages respectively.
4. **Voice Message Processing**: The `handle_voice` method loads the voice message, saves it locally, and calls the `transcribe_voice` method (currently a stub) to transcribe the audio.
5. **Document File Processing**: The `handle_document` method loads the document file, saves it locally, and reads the contents of the text document.
6. **Text Message Processing**: The `handle_message` method simply echoes the received text message back to the user.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Initialize the Telegram bot
bot = TelegramBot('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')

# Run the bot
bot.run_polling()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
