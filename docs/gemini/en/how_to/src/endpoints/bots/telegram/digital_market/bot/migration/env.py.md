**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block implements the migration process for the database schema using Alembic. It allows for both offline and online migration execution, handling database connections and configuration.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import Libraries**: The code starts by importing necessary libraries for handling database connections, migration, and logging.
2. **Configure Environment**: The code sets up the Alembic configuration, specifying the database URL and loading configuration from a file if provided.
3. **Define `run_migrations_offline`**: This function handles offline migrations. It configures the context with the database URL and executes migrations without creating an Engine, allowing migration execution without a database connection.
4. **Define `do_run_migrations`**: This function handles the execution of migrations given a database connection. It configures the context with the connection and executes the migrations.
5. **Define `run_async_migrations`**: This function handles online migrations. It creates an asynchronous Engine, connects to the database, and executes the `do_run_migrations` function within an asynchronous context.
6. **Define `run_migrations_online`**: This function serves as the entry point for online migrations. It runs the `run_async_migrations` function asynchronously.
7. **Conditional Execution**: The code checks if it's running in offline mode. If so, it calls `run_migrations_offline`. Otherwise, it calls `run_migrations_online`.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.bots.telegram.digital_market.bot.migration.env import run_migrations_online

# Execute migrations in online mode
run_migrations_online() 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
