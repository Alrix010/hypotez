**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines an admin panel for a Telegram bot, providing functionalities like:

- **Admin Panel Access**: Restricts access to the admin panel to users with IDs specified in `settings.ADMIN_IDS`.
- **Statistics**: Fetches and displays user statistics, including total users, new users today, week, and month, and payment statistics.
- **Product Management**: Allows admins to manage products, including adding, deleting, and viewing them.
- **Product Deletion**: Enables admins to delete products from the database.
- **Product Addition**: Guides admins through a step-by-step process to add a new product. This process includes:
    - Inputting product name, description, price, and category.
    - Optionally uploading a file associated with the product.
    - Providing hidden content that appears after a purchase.
    - Confirming the product details before saving to the database.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Admin Panel Access**:
    - The `start_admin` function checks if the user ID is in the `settings.ADMIN_IDS` list.
    - If authorized, it presents the user with the admin panel menu using `admin_kb()`.
    - If unauthorized, it denies access and provides an error message.

2. **Statistics**:
    - The `admin_statistic` function fetches user statistics from `UserDAO` and payment statistics from `PurchaseDao`.
    - It then constructs a message containing the statistics and sends it back to the user.

3. **Product Management**:
    - The `admin_process_products` function presents the admin with options to add or delete products.

4. **Product Deletion**:
    - The `admin_process_start_dell` function displays all existing products with their details.
    - Users can then click on a button to delete a specific product, triggering the `admin_process_start_dell` function.
    - The `admin_process_start_dell` function deletes the selected product from the database.

5. **Product Addition**:
    - The `admin_process_add_product` function initializes the `AddProduct` state machine and prompts the admin to enter the product name.
    - Subsequent functions (`admin_process_name`, `admin_process_description`, `admin_process_category`, `admin_process_price`, `admin_process_without_file`, `admin_process_hidden_content`) guide the admin through each step of the product addition process.
    - The `admin_process_confirm_add` function confirms the product details and saves it to the database.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Example usage:
# Simulate a user with an admin ID
user_id = settings.ADMIN_IDS[0]

# Simulate a message from the user
message = Message(from_user=User(id=user_id), text="/start")

# Process the message using the admin router
await admin_router.resolve(message)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
