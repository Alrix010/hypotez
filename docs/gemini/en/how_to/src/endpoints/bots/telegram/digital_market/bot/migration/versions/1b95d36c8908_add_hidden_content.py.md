**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet is an Alembic migration script that adds a new column named `hidden_content` to the `products` table in a database. The column is of type `sa.Text`, meaning it can store large amounts of text data, and is set to be `nullable=False`, indicating that it cannot be empty. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **`upgrade()` Function**:
    - This function is called when running the migration to upgrade the database.
    - It uses `op.add_column()` to add the new `hidden_content` column to the `products` table.

2. **`downgrade()` Function**:
    - This function is called when reverting the migration.
    - It uses `op.drop_column()` to remove the `hidden_content` column from the `products` table.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Assuming you have an Alembic environment configured
from alembic import command
from alembic.config import Config

alembic_cfg = Config('path/to/alembic.ini')  # Replace with your actual path
command.upgrade(alembic_cfg, 'head')  # This runs all migrations up to the latest version
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
