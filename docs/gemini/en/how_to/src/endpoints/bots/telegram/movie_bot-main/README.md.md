## Instructions for Generating Code Documentation

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

### How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

**Description**
-------------------------
This section provides instructions for setting up and running the Movie Bot, a Telegram bot designed to search for links to watch movies and TV shows for free. The bot uses the Aiogram library for Telegram interaction, Google services for associative search, and the Kinopoisk library and [w2.kpfr/wiki](https://w2.kpfr.wiki/) service for movie data. It includes anti-spam measures using middlewares and employs BeautifulSoup for parsing.

**Execution Steps**
-------------------------
1. **Clone the Project**: Download the project repository to your computer.
2. **Create an `.env` File**: Create a file named `.env` in the project directory and populate it with the following environment variable:
    ```
    TOKEN=123456789 # Your Telegram bot token
    ```
3. **Create a Virtual Environment (if you don't have one)**:
    ```shell
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    ```shell
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
4. **Install Dependencies**: Update pip and install the required dependencies:
    ```shell
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. **Run the Bot**: Execute the `run.py` script:
    ```shell
    python run.py
    ```

**Usage Example**
-------------------------
```python
# ... [Code for bot functionality] ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
