**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the `BotHandler` Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `BotHandler` class implements the logic for handling various commands and events received by the Telegram bot. It defines methods to process URLs, commands like `--next`, text messages, voice messages, document files, and log messages. Additionally, it handles standard Telegram bot commands like `/start`, `/help`, and `/sendpdf`.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `BotHandler` is initialized, potentially setting up connections or resources needed for processing events.
2. **Event Handling**: When a Telegram event occurs (e.g., a user sends a message), the appropriate method within `BotHandler` is called. 
   - **`handle_url`**: Processes URLs, potentially extracting information or performing actions related to the provided URL.
   - **`handle_next_command`**: Handles the `--next` command and its variants, likely used for navigating through data or content.
   - **`handle_message`**: Handles generic text messages, potentially logging the message or replying with a default message.
   - **`start`**: Handles the `/start` command, usually providing a welcome message and instructions.
   - **`help_command`**: Handles the `/help` command, displaying available commands and their descriptions.
   - **`send_pdf`**: Handles the `/sendpdf` command, generating and sending a PDF file to the user.
   - **`handle_voice`**: Processes voice messages, transcribing the audio into text using a speech recognition service (not yet implemented).
   - **`handle_document`**: Handles received documents, saving them locally and potentially extracting information.
   - **`handle_log`**: Handles log messages, logging the message to the system and potentially providing confirmation.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.bots.telegram.handlers import BotHandler

# Initialize the BotHandler
handler = BotHandler()

# Example: Handling a URL
update =  # ... (Create a Telegram Update object)
context =  # ... (Create a Telegram CallbackContext object)
await handler.handle_url(update, context)

# Example: Handling a text message
update =  # ... (Create a Telegram Update object)
context =  # ... (Create a Telegram CallbackContext object)
await handler.handle_message(update, context)

# Example: Handling the /start command
update =  # ... (Create a Telegram Update object)
context =  # ... (Create a Telegram CallbackContext object)
await handler.start(update, context)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
