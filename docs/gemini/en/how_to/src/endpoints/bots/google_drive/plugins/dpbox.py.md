**Instructions for Generating a Downloadable Dropbox Link**

========================================================================================

**Description**
-------------------------
The `DPBOX` function takes a Dropbox URL as input and converts it into a downloadable link. It checks for specific patterns in the URL and modifies it to generate a direct download link. 

**Execution Steps**
-------------------------
1. **Check for Dropbox Domain**: The function first checks if the URL contains either "dl.dropbox.com" or "www.dropbox.com". 
2. **Process "dl.dropbox.com" URLs**: If the URL contains "dl.dropbox.com", the function checks if it has "?dl=0" or "?dl=1" in the query string.
    - If it has "?dl=0", the function replaces it with "?dl=1" to generate a downloadable link.
    - If it has "?dl=1", the function keeps the URL as is.
    - If it doesn't have either, the function appends "?dl=1" to the URL to generate a downloadable link.
3. **Process "www.dropbox.com" URLs**: If the URL contains "www.dropbox.com", the function replaces it with "dl.dropbox.com" and then checks if the query string contains "?dl=0" or "?dl=1".
    - If it has "?dl=0", the function replaces it with "?dl=1".
    - If it has "?dl=1", the function keeps the URL as is.
    - If it doesn't have either, the function appends "?dl=1" to the URL.
4. **Process Other URLs**: If the URL doesn't contain either "dl.dropbox.com" or "www.dropbox.com", the function checks if the query string contains "?dl=0" or "?dl=1".
    - If it has "?dl=0", the function replaces it with "?dl=1".
    - If it has "?dl=1", the function keeps the URL as is.
    - If it doesn't have either, the function appends "?dl=1" to the URL.
5. **Return Downloadable Link**: After processing the URL, the function returns the modified URL which is a direct download link.

**Usage Example**
-------------------------

```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.bots.google_drive.plugins.dpbox import DPBOX

    # Example Dropbox URL
    url = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/xyz123abc/my_file.pdf?dl=0"

    # Get the downloadable link
    download_link = DPBOX(url)

    # Print the downloadable link
    print(f"Downloadable link: {download_link}")

```
