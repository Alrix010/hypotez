**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a class called `Mega` that provides a Python interface for interacting with Mega cloud storage. It allows users to log in, upload and download files, and manage their files. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: 
    - The `Mega` class is initialized with a unique sequence number (`seqno`) and sets the session ID (`sid`) to `None`.
2. **Authentication**:
    - `Mega.from_credentials(email, password)` logs in using an email and password.
    - `Mega.from_ephemeral()` logs in anonymously using an ephemeral account.
3. **API Requests**:
    - The `api_req` method sends requests to the Mega API with the specified data and parameters. 
4. **User Login**:
    - `login_user(email, password)` logs in using an email and password.
    - `login_ephemeral()` logs in anonymously using an ephemeral account.
5. **Common Login Logic**:
    - `_login_common` handles the common login logic, decrypting the master key, setting the session ID, and storing the RSA private key if needed.
6. **File Management**:
    - `get_files()` retrieves a list of files and folders from the Mega account.
    - `download_from_url(url)` downloads a file from a Mega public URL.
    - `download_file(file_id, file_key, public=False, store_path=None)` downloads a file, handling both public and private files.
7. **Upload Files**:
    - `uploadfile(filename, dst=None)` uploads a file to the specified destination folder. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from mega import Mega

# Login using email and password
mega = Mega.from_credentials("your_email@example.com", "your_password")

# Upload a file
file_path = "path/to/your/file.txt"
upload_result = mega.uploadfile(file_path)

# Download a file from a public URL
public_url = "https://mega.nz/#!file_id!file_key"
downloaded_file_path = mega.download_from_url(public_url)

# Print results
print(f"Upload result: {upload_result}")
print(f"Downloaded file: {downloaded_file_path}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
