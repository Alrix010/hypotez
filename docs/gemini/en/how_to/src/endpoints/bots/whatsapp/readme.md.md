**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code implements an automated WhatsApp message sender using Python. It allows the user to configure the number of messages to send and the time range for sending. For stable operation, it's essential to monitor updates to the libraries and the web version of WhatsApp.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import Libraries**: The code first imports required libraries:
    - `pywhatkit`: for interacting with the WhatsApp web version and sending messages.
    - `pyautogui`: for automating mouse and keyboard actions.
    - `pynput`: for controlling keyboard input.
    - `emoji`: for adding emojis to messages.
    - `random`: for generating random messages and times.
    - `time`: for managing delays and execution time.

2. **Define a Function to Send Messages**:
    - `send_whatsapp_message`: This function handles the sending of messages:
        - It accepts the phone number, message, hour, and minutes for sending.
        - Uses `pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg` to initiate sending.
        - Applies a delay using `time.sleep` for WhatsApp Web loading.
        - Uses `pyautogui` and `pynput` to simulate pressing the "Enter" key for sending.
        - Includes exception handling (`try...except`) to display errors.

3. **Create a Message Pool**:
    - A list `messages` is created to store messages.
    - `emoji.emojize` is used to add emojis.
    - `random.choice` randomly selects a message from the pool.

4. **Get User Input**:
    - The user is prompted for the number of messages (`num_messages`), starting hour (`start_hour`), and ending hour (`end_hour`).

5. **Main Sending Loop**:
    - A `while` loop continues until the message count (`message_count`) reaches the desired number.
    - Random hours and minutes are generated.
    - The `send_whatsapp_message` function is called with the received data.
    - The message count is incremented.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# ... (Code ) ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
