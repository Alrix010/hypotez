**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This script creates a Telegram bot that interacts with a conversational AI model (likely a large language model like ChatGPT). It responds to user messages and voice messages with text generated by the model, and can also process text documents uploaded by the user. The bot is built using the `python-telegram-bot` library, allowing it to handle various interactions from Telegram users. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:**
    - The script imports necessary libraries like `telegram`, `speech_recognition`, `pydub`, `gtts`, and `requests`.
    - It initializes a `Model` object, which likely represents the AI model used for generating responses.
    - The script retrieves the Telegram bot token from a credential file.

2. **Command Handlers:**
    - The script defines several functions that handle different commands and messages received from Telegram users.
    - `/start`: This command starts the bot and greets the user.
    - `/help`: This command displays a list of available commands.

3. **Message Handlers:**
    - **Text messages:**  The `handle_message` function receives text messages, sends them to the AI model, and replies with the model's generated response.
    - **Voice messages:** The `handle_voice` function receives voice messages, converts them to text using speech recognition, sends the text to the AI model, and replies with a text response and an audio version of the response.
    - **Documents:** The `handle_document` function receives document files (like text files), sends their content to the AI model, and replies with a text response.

4. **Main Function:**
    - The `main` function sets up the Telegram bot application using the token retrieved earlier.
    - It registers the command handlers and message handlers defined previously.
    - Finally, it starts the bot to listen for incoming messages and commands.

Usage Example
-------------------------
```python
from src.bots.openai_bots.telegram_bot_trainer import main

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main() 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
