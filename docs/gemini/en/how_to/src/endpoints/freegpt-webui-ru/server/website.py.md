**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:\n    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================\n

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a `Website` class, which handles routing and serving content for the web application. It sets up various routes for different pages and functionalities, including the chat page, asset serving, and a redirect to the chat page. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `Website` class is initialized with the Flask application object.
2. **Route Definition**: The `routes` dictionary maps URLs to corresponding functions and methods for handling requests.
    - **`/`**: Redirects to `/chat`.
    - **`/chat/`**: Calls the `_index` method to render the chat page with a unique chat ID.
    - **`/chat/<conversation_id>`**: Calls the `_chat` method to render the chat page with the provided conversation ID.
    - **`/assets/<folder>/<file>`**: Calls the `_assets` method to serve static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files from the `client` directory.
3. **Route Handling**: The defined routes are then added to the Flask application using the `add_url_rule` method.
4. **`_index` Method**:
    - Generates a new unique chat ID by combining a random hex string with the current timestamp.
    - Renders the `index.html` template with the generated chat ID.
5. **`_chat` Method**:
    - Checks if the provided conversation ID contains a hyphen (`-`). If not, redirects to the `/chat` page.
    - Renders the `index.html` template with the given chat ID.
6. **`_assets` Method**:
    - Attempts to serve the requested asset file from the `client` directory.
    - If the file is not found, returns a 404 "File not found" error.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)
    website = Website(app)

    # ... other Flask configuration ...

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
