**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block initializes a Flask app, which is a web framework for Python.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. Imports the `Flask` class from the `flask` library.
2. Creates an instance of the `Flask` class, naming it `app`.
3. Sets the template folder for the Flask app to `./../client/html`. This specifies where the HTML templates for the web application are located.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='./../client/html')

    # ... further Flask app configuration and routing ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
