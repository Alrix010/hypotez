**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a `Model` class that represents different large language models (LLMs) and their properties. It provides a mapping between model names and their corresponding providers, base providers, and recommended providers. This information is used by other parts of the project to select the appropriate provider for a given model.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a nested `model` class within the `Model` class. This inner class defines the structure of a model object, which includes `name`, `base_provider`, and `best_provider` attributes.
2. It then defines a series of classes, each representing a specific LLM. Each class inherits from the `model` class and sets the specific model name, base provider, and recommended provider for that particular model.
3. The `ModelUtils` class is defined, which contains a `convert` dictionary that maps model names to their corresponding model classes within the `Model` class. 

Usage Example
-------------------------
```python
    from g4f import Provider
    from src.endpoints.freegpt-webui-ru.g4f.models import Model, ModelUtils

    # Access a specific model by name
    gpt_35_turbo_model = Model.gpt_35_turbo

    # Get the recommended provider for a model
    recommended_provider = gpt_35_turbo_model.best_provider

    # Use the ModelUtils class to get the corresponding model class for a given model name
    model_class = ModelUtils.convert['gpt-3.5-turbo'] 

    # Access attributes of the model class
    model_name = model_class.name
    base_provider = model_class.base_provider 

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
