**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block implements a DeepAI provider for the g4f (Generative AI Framework) project. It provides a function for sending messages to the DeepAI API and receiving responses.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules**: The code starts by importing necessary modules like `os`, `json`, `random`, `hashlib`, and `requests`. It also imports `sha256`, `Dict`, and `get_type_hints` from the `typing` module.
2. **Define global variables**: The code defines several global variables:
    - `url`: The base URL for DeepAI.
    - `model`: A list containing the supported model (currently only "gpt-3.5-turbo").
    - `supports_stream`: Indicates whether the provider supports streaming responses (True in this case).
    - `needs_auth`: Indicates whether the provider requires authentication (False in this case).
3. **Define `_create_completion` function**: This function sends messages to the DeepAI API and receives responses. It performs the following actions:
    - **Define `md5` function**: This function calculates the MD5 hash of a given text.
    - **Define `get_api_key` function**: This function generates an API key based on a provided user agent.
    - **Set up headers**: It sets up headers for the request, including an API key and a user agent.
    - **Prepare files**: It prepares files for the request, including a chat style and chat history.
    - **Send the request**: It sends a POST request to the DeepAI API using the prepared headers and files.
    - **Iterate through response**: It iterates through the response, decoding each chunk and yielding it.
4. **Define `params`**: This variable defines the parameters of the DeepAI provider and its supported features. It uses the `get_type_hints` function to retrieve type annotations for the `_create_completion` function.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from g4f.Providers.DeepAi import _create_completion

# Example messages for the chatbot
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm doing well, thanks for asking! How about you?"}
]

# Send messages to the DeepAI API and get the response
for chunk in _create_completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages, stream=True):
    print(chunk, end="")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
