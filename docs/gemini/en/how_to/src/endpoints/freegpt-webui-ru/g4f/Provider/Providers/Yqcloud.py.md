How to Use the Yqcloud Provider
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Yqcloud.py` file implements a provider for the `g4f` framework, enabling interactions with the Yqcloud AI chatbot service. This provider allows users to send messages and receive responses from the Yqcloud API, leveraging the `gpt-3.5-turbo` language model.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `Yqcloud` provider initializes with the base URL `'https://chat9.yqcloud.top/'` and defines the supported model (`'gpt-3.5-turbo'`). It also sets flags for streaming support (`True`) and authentication (`False`).
2. **Message Handling**: The `_create_completion` function takes a model name, a list of messages, and a streaming flag as input. It constructs a JSON payload with the messages, a unique user ID, and other necessary parameters.
3. **API Request**: The function makes a POST request to the Yqcloud API (`'https://api.aichatos.cloud/api/generateStream'`) with the constructed JSON payload.
4. **Streaming Response**: The response from the API is streamed, and each chunk of data is decoded and yielded. The streaming ensures that responses are delivered incrementally as they are generated.
5. **Filtering**: The code filters out the initial response that includes the phrase "always respond in english" to ensure only the actual generated content is returned.

Usage Example
-------------------------
```python
from g4f.Providers import Yqcloud

# Create a Yqcloud provider instance
yqcloud_provider = Yqcloud()

# Define messages for the chatbot interaction
messages = [
    {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, how are you?'},
]

# Generate a completion using the provider
for response_chunk in yqcloud_provider.create_completion(model='gpt-3.5-turbo', messages=messages, stream=True):
    print(response_chunk, end='')
```

```python
