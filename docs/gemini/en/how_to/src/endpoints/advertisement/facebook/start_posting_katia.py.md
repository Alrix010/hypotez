**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet demonstrates how to initiate Facebook advertisement posting for a specific set of campaigns, using the `FacebookPromoter` class. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import Required Modules:** Imports necessary modules for web driver interaction, Facebook promotion logic, and logging.
2. **Initialize Web Driver:** Sets up a Chrome browser instance using `Driver` class from the `webdriver` module.
3. **Define Target Groups:** Specifies a list of filenames containing information about the target groups for the advertisements.
4. **Define Campaigns:** Lists the campaigns to be promoted, including categories like 'sport_and_activity', 'bags_backpacks_suitcases', etc.
5. **Initialize Promoter:** Instantiates a `FacebookPromoter` object, providing the web driver, group file paths, and indicating the need for video content.
6. **Run Campaigns:** Starts the promotion process by calling the `run_campaigns` method on the `promoter` object, passing the list of campaigns.
7. **Handle Keyboard Interruption:**  Includes a `try-except` block to gracefully handle potential user interruptions with `KeyboardInterrupt`. Logs the interruption using the `logger` module.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver, Chrome
from src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.promoter import FacebookPromoter

# Define group file paths
filenames = ['katia_homepage.json']

# Define campaigns to promote
campaigns = ['sport_and_activity', 'bags_backpacks_suitcases', 'pain', 'brands', 'mom_and_baby', 'house']

# Initialize web driver
driver = Driver(Chrome)

# Initialize promoter
promoter = FacebookPromoter(driver, group_file_paths=filenames, no_video=False)

# Run the campaigns
promoter.run_campaigns(campaigns)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
