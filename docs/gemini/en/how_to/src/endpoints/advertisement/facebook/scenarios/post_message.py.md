**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `post_message` function manages the process of creating a post on Facebook, including adding title, description, and media files.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Post Title and Description:**
    - Opens the 'add post' box on Facebook.
    - Enters the title and description from the provided `message` object.
    - If the `message` is a string, it's directly added as the post content.

2. **Media Upload:**
    - Opens the 'add media' form.
    - If the `message` has `products`, the function iterates through the products and attempts to upload each media file.
    - Handles both image and video uploads based on the `local_image_path` or `local_video_path` attributes of the product object.
    - Updates captions for the uploaded media with product details.

3. **Publish Post:**
    - Completes the editing process and publishes the post.
    - The function handles potential pop-ups or errors during the publishing process and retries up to 5 times.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    driver = Driver(Chrome)  # Initialize WebDriver
    message = SimpleNamespace(title="Campaign Title", description="Campaign Description", products=[
        SimpleNamespace(local_image_path='path/to/image1.jpg'),
        SimpleNamespace(local_image_path='path/to/image2.jpg')
    ]) 
    post_message(driver, message)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
