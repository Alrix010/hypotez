**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a script that automates Facebook group event promotion. It uses the `FacebookPromoter` class to manage and post events to specific Facebook groups.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize Driver:** Creates a WebDriver instance to interact with the browser. In this case, it uses Chrome.
2. **Load Configuration Files:** Reads event names from the `events_names` list and group file paths from the `filenames` list. It excludes files listed in `excluded_filenames`.
3. **Create Promoter Instance:** Instantiates the `FacebookPromoter` class, providing the WebDriver and the list of group files. The `no_video` argument is set to `True` to indicate that the promoter should not include videos in the events.
4. **Run Events Loop:** Enters an infinite loop, executing the following steps:
    - **Wake Up:** Logs a debug message indicating the current time.
    - **Run Events:** Calls the `run_events` method of the `FacebookPromoter` instance, specifying the event names and group file paths.
    - **Sleep:** Waits for a specific duration (7200 seconds, which is 2 hours).
5. **Keyboard Interrupt Handling:** Includes a `KeyboardInterrupt` handler to gracefully stop the script if the user presses Ctrl+C. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.start_event import FacebookPromoter

# Initialize a WebDriver
driver = Driver(Chrome)

# Define event names and group file paths
events_names = ["choice_day_01_10"]
filenames = [ "my_managed_groups.json", "usa.json", "he_il.json", "ru_il.json", "katia_homepage.json", "ru_usd.json", "ger_en_eur.json"]

# Create a Facebook promoter instance
promoter = FacebookPromoter(driver, group_file_paths=filenames, no_video=True)

# Run events for a specified duration
promoter.run_events(events_names=events_names, group_file_paths=filenames)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
