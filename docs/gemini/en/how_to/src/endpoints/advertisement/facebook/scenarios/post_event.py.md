**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines several functions for posting an event on a Facebook group using a web driver. These functions handle posting the event title, date, time, and description. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Load Locators**: The code begins by loading locators from a JSON file, which define the elements on the Facebook webpage that need to be interacted with. 
2. **Post Title**: The `post_title` function sends the event title to the appropriate input field on the Facebook webpage.
3. **Post Date**: The `post_date` function sends the event date to the appropriate input field.
4. **Post Time**: The `post_time` function sends the event time to the appropriate input field.
5. **Post Description**: The `post_description` function sends the event description to the appropriate input field. 
6. **Post Event**: The `post_event` function orchestrates the entire posting process. It calls the previous functions to post the title, date, time, and description. It then clicks the button to submit the event. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from src import gs
    from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
    from src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.scenarios.post_event import post_event

    # Assuming you have a driver object and an event object
    driver = Driver(...)
    event = SimpleNamespace(title="Campaign Title", description="Event Description", start="2024-03-15 10:00") 

    # Post the event
    post_event(driver, event) 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
