**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `FacebookPromoter` class is designed to promote AliExpress products and events in Facebook groups. It uses a WebDriver instance to automate the posting process, ensuring that categories and events are promoted while avoiding duplicates.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** The `FacebookPromoter` class is initialized with a WebDriver instance, a list of file paths containing group data, and an optional flag to disable videos in posts.
2. **Promotion:** The `promote` method promotes a category or event in a Facebook group. It checks if the group's language and currency match the item's, and then proceeds to post the content.
3. **Group Processing:** The `process_groups` method iterates through all the groups in the provided file paths. For each group, it checks if the promotion interval has passed, validates the group data, and then attempts to promote a category or event.
4. **Category Item Retrieval:** The `get_category_item` method retrieves a category item for promotion based on the campaign name and promoter. It shuffles the categories and selects a random one for promotion.
5. **Interval Check:** The `check_interval` method checks if enough time has passed for promoting a specific group.
6. **Group Validation:** The `validate_group` method ensures that the group data is correct.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.promoter import FacebookPromoter
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
from src.webdriver.browsers import Chrome

# Initialize WebDriver instance
driver = Driver(Chrome)

# Initialize FacebookPromoter object
promoter = FacebookPromoter(d=driver, promoter='aliexpress', group_file_paths=['group_data.json'])

# Process groups for a specific campaign
promoter.process_groups(campaign_name='summer_sale', group_categories_to_adv=['sales'])

# Process groups for a specific event
event = {'name': 'summer_event', 'start': '2024-06-01', 'end': '2024-06-30'}
promoter.process_groups(events=[event], is_event=True)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
