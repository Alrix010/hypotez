**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet defines a function `main` that runs a Facebook advertising campaign. The campaign runs on a cycle, posting ads to targeted Facebook groups in different languages and currencies.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize Driver**: The code starts by initializing a Chrome WebDriver instance.
2. **Open Facebook**: The WebDriver navigates to the Facebook website.
3. **Run Campaign Loop**: The code enters a `while True` loop to run the campaign continuously.
4. **Check Time Interval**: The code checks if the current time falls within a predefined interval for stopping the campaign. If it's within the interval, the program prints "Good night!" and sleeps for 1000 seconds.
5. **Run Campaign Cycle**: The `campaign_cycle` function is called to execute the campaign for different language and currency combinations.
6. **Log and Sleep**: After the campaign cycle, the program logs the sleep time and sleeps for a random duration between 30 and 360 seconds.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.start_sergey import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
