**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a Markdown file structure for an asynchronous Facebook post message scenario. The file includes an overview, key features, module structure, function documentation, usage instructions, dependencies, error handling information, contributing guidelines, and licensing details.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Define File Structure**: The code defines a basic Markdown file structure, including headings, sections, and lists for different aspects of the scenario documentation.
2. **Add Description**: It includes a description of the script's purpose, which is to automate the process of posting messages on Facebook.
3. **List Key Features**: The script outlines the key features of the scenario, including sending messages, uploading media files, and promoting posts.
4. **Visualize Module Structure**: The `mermaid` code snippet visualizes the flow of the script, highlighting the sequence of actions and decision points.
5. **Document Functions**: The code provides detailed documentation for each function involved in the scenario, including their purpose, parameters, and return values.
6. **Include Usage Instructions**: It explains how to use the script, providing an example demonstrating the steps involved in initializing the driver, loading data, and calling functions.
7. **Mention Dependencies**: The script lists the necessary dependencies, including libraries like `selenium`, `asyncio`, and `pathlib`.
8. **Address Error Handling**: The code highlights the importance of robust error handling in the script, especially when dealing with dynamic web pages.
9. **Encourage Contributions**: It welcomes contributions to the script, emphasizing the importance of documentation and testing.
10. **Specify License**: The script includes information about the license under which it is released, using the MIT License in this case.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
from types import SimpleNamespace

# Initialize Driver
driver = Driver(...)

# Load category and products
category = SimpleNamespace(title="Campaign Title", description="Campaign Description")
products = [SimpleNamespace(local_image_path='path/to/image.jpg', ...)]

# Send title
post_title(driver, category)

# Upload media and promote post
await promote_post(driver, category, products)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
