**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Facebook` class provides functionality to interact with Facebook using a web driver. It allows you to log in, promote posts, and perform other actions on the platform.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the `Facebook` instance with a driver object, promoter name, and a list of group file paths. It also sets up the starting page URL.
2. **Login**: The `login` method triggers the login process for the provided account using the `login` scenario.
3. **Promote Post**: The `promote_post` method promotes a post by sending the provided message to the form.
4. **Promote Event**: The `promote_event` method is an example function for promoting an event.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.webdirver import Chrome, Firefox, Driver
from src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.facebook import Facebook

driver = Driver(Chrome)
facebook = Facebook(driver, 'hypotez_promoter', ['group_file_path1', 'group_file_path2'])

# Log in to Facebook
facebook.login()

# Promote a post
item = SimpleNamespace(message="This is a promotional message")
success = facebook.promote_post(item)
if success:
    print("Post promoted successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to promote the post.")

# Promote an event
# Implement your logic for promoting an event in the promote_event method.
facebook.promote_event(event)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
