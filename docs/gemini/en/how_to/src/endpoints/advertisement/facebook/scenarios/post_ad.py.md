**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `post_ad` function sends a promotional post on Facebook. It takes a `Driver` object and an `SimpleNamespace` object called `message` as input. The function first tries to send the post title using the `post_message_title` function. If successful, it then attempts to upload a media file (if present) using the `upload_post_media` function. Finally, the function publishes the post using the `message_publish` function. The function includes error handling and retries if there are failures, but eventually stops if it exceeds a certain number of attempts.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The function checks if the post title was successfully sent using the `post_message_title` function. If it fails, the function logs an error and increments a global `fails` counter. If the counter exceeds 15, the function exits.
2. If the `message` object contains an `image_path` attribute, the function tries to upload the image using the `upload_post_media` function.
3. The function then publishes the post using the `message_publish` function.
4. If all steps are successful, the function resets the `fails` counter and returns `True`.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    driver = Driver(Chrome)
    message = SimpleNamespace(description="This is a test post", image_path="/path/to/image.jpg")
    result = post_ad(driver, message)
    if result:
        print("Post published successfully!")
    else:
        print("Failed to publish post.")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
