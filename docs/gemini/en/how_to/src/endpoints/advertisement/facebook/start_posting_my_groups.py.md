**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet implements a script that automatically posts advertisements to Facebook groups using the `FacebookPromoter` class. It leverages a `webdriver` for browser automation and a `logger` for logging events.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize a WebDriver**: The code initializes a `Chrome` webdriver for browser automation.
2. **Navigate to Facebook**: The script navigates to the Facebook website.
3. **Define Campaign Filenames and Campaign Names**: The code sets up lists for storing filenames of group data and the names of advertising campaigns.
4. **Instantiate Facebook Promoter**: The script creates an instance of `FacebookPromoter`, passing in the webdriver, group file paths, and a flag to indicate that videos are not included in the promotions.
5. **Loop through Campaigns**: The script enters a loop that continues indefinitely until interrupted. Inside the loop:
    - The `run_campaigns` method of the `FacebookPromoter` class is called to run the defined campaigns using the group data.
    - The `copy.copy` function is used to create a copy of the `campaigns` list to avoid modifying the original list.
6. **Handle Keyboard Interruption**: The script catches a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception, which is triggered when the user presses Ctrl+C. Upon catching the exception, it logs a message indicating that the campaign promotion was interrupted.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Initialize a Chrome WebDriver
d = Driver(Chrome)

# Navigate to Facebook
d.get_url(r"https://facebook.com")

# Define campaign filenames and campaigns
filenames: list = ['my_managed_groups.json']
campaigns: list = ['brands', 'mom_and_baby', 'pain', 'sport_and_activity', 'house', 'bags_backpacks_suitcases', 'man']

# Instantiate Facebook Promoter
promoter = FacebookPromoter(d, group_file_paths=filenames, no_video=True)

# Run campaigns in a loop
try:
    while True:
        # Run the campaigns
        promoter.run_campaigns(campaigns=copy.copy(campaigns), group_file_paths=filenames)
        # ... (Additional code may be added here for handling errors or other tasks)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # Log the interruption
    logger.info("Campaign promotion interrupted.")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
