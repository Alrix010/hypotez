**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block defines a `FacebookFields` class which loads Facebook fields from a JSON file (`facebook_feilds.json`) located in the `src/advertisement/facebok` directory of the project. The class uses the `j_loads` function to read the JSON file and populates its attributes with the loaded data. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `FacebookFields` class is initialized.
2. The `_payload` method is called, which loads the JSON data from `facebook_feilds.json`.
3. If the data is successfully loaded, the `_payload` method populates the class attributes with the values from the JSON data.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.facebook_fields import FacebookFields

# Initialize the FacebookFields class
facebook_fields = FacebookFields()

# Access the loaded fields
print(facebook_fields.field_name)  # Example: 'field_name' is a field from the JSON file
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
