**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block retrieves a list of products from a specified directory, formats a query with a predefined system instruction and product data, and sends the query to a Google Generative AI model. The model's response is then parsed and saved to a JSON file. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code first defines paths to the directory containing products, system instructions, and a directory for storing the model responses. 
2. It reads the product list from a JSON file located in the `products_in_test_dir` directory. 
3. It loads system instructions from text files. 
4. It initializes a GoogleGenerativeAi object with an API key and the system instruction. 
5. It constructs a query in Russian or Hebrew by combining the command instruction and the product list. 
6. The `model_ask()` function sends the query to the model and parses the response. 
7. It saves the responses in JSON files with timestamps for Russian and Hebrew queries. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.kazarinov.scenarios._experiments.ask_model import model_ask, q_ru, q_he

# Send a query in Russian and save the response
response_ru_dict = model_ask('ru')
# Save the response to a JSON file
j_dumps(response_ru_dict,gs.path.external_storage / 'kazarinov' / 'mexironim' / '24_12_07_19_06_40_508' / f'ru_{gs.now}.json')

# Send a query in Hebrew and save the response
response_he_dict = model_ask('he')
# Save the response to a JSON file
j_dumps(response_he_dict, gs.path.external_storage / 'kazarinov' / 'mexironim' / '24_12_07_19_06_40_508' / f'he_{gs.now}.json')
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
