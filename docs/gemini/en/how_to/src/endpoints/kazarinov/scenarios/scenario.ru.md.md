**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This script is part of the `hypotez/src/endpoints/kazarinov/scenarios` directory and is designed to automate the process of creating a "mexiron" for Sergey Kazarinov. The script retrieves, parses, and processes product data from various suppliers, prepares the data, processes it through AI, and integrates with Facebook to publish the products.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: Initializes the `MexironBuilder` class with the required components.
2. **Configuration Loading**: Loads the configuration from a JSON file.
3. **Export Path Setting**: Sets the path for exporting data.
4. **System Instruction Loading**: Loads system instructions for the AI model.
5. **AI Model Initialization**: Initializes the Google Generative AI model.
6. **Scenario Execution**: Executes the main scenario, including parsing products, processing them through AI, and saving the data.
7. **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling to ensure that the script continues executing even if some elements are not found or if there are issues with the web page.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
from src.endpoints.kazarinov.scenarios.scenario_pricelist import MexironBuilder

# Initialize Driver
driver = Driver(...)

# Initialize MexironBuilder
mexiron_builder = MexironBuilder(driver)

# Run the scenario
urls = ['https://example.com/product1', 'https://example.com/product2']
mexiron_builder.run_scenario(urls=urls)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
