**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a Telegram bot that interacts with users and performs specific tasks based on user input. The bot uses the `telebot` library for interacting with the Telegram API, and it utilizes various functions to handle messages, commands, and other interactions.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a `Config` class to store bot configuration settings such as the bot token, channel ID, and other parameters.
2. It then creates a `BotHandler` class that handles the logic for processing user messages and commands.
3. The `BotHandler` class has methods to handle various types of user input:
    - `handle_message`: This method handles text messages and determines the appropriate action based on the message content.
    - `_send_user_flowchart`: This method sends a flowchart image to the user.
    - `_handle_url`: This method processes URLs sent by the user and extracts relevant data from them.
    - `_handle_next_command`: This method responds to user commands related to the next step in the bot's flow.
    - `help_command`: This method provides information about available commands to the user.
    - `send_pdf`: This method sends a PDF file to the user.
    - `handle_voice`: This method handles voice messages and transcribes them into text (currently a placeholder).
    - `handle_document`: This method handles documents sent by the user and saves them locally.
4. The main bot instance is initialized with the configured bot token.
5. The code defines several message handlers using `@bot.message_handler`, each handling a specific type of message:
    - `command_start`: Handles the `/start` command.
    - `command_help`: Handles the `/help` command.
    - `command_info`: Handles the `/info` command.
    - `command_time`: Handles the `/time` command.
    - `command_photo`: Handles the `/photo` command.
    - `handle_voice_message`: Handles voice messages.
    - `handle_document_message`: Handles document messages.
    - `handle_text_message`: Handles general text messages.
    - `handle_unknown_command`: Handles unknown commands.
6. The `run_bot` function starts the bot's polling loop, listening for incoming messages and handling them accordingly.
7. The bot continuously runs in an infinite loop, automatically restarting if an exception occurs during polling.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Import the bot module
from src.endpoints.kazarinov.minibot import run_bot

# Start the bot
run_bot()

# Send a message to the bot
# You can interact with the bot using the Telegram client, 
# sending messages and commands as described in the help message.
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
