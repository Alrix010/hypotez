**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet sets up a simple FastAPI application that provides a basic chat interface using the Google Generative AI API. It loads configuration, defines a chat request model, initializes a GoogleGenerativeAi model, and creates routes for the root endpoint and the chat endpoint.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Load Configuration**: The code loads configuration from a JSON file, including host, port range, API key, model name, and system instructions for the Gemini model.
2. **Create FastAPI Application**: A FastAPI application (`app`) is initialized and CORS middleware is configured to allow requests from any origin.
3. **Define Chat Request Model**: A Pydantic model (`ChatRequest`) is defined to represent a chat request, containing the user's message.
4. **Initialize GoogleGenerativeAi Model**: A GoogleGenerativeAi model (`model`) is initialized using the loaded API key, model name, and system instructions.
5. **Create Root Route**: A route is defined for the root (`/`) endpoint, which serves an HTML index page from the `html` directory.
6. **Create Chat Route**: A POST route is defined for the `/api/chat` endpoint, which accepts chat requests and sends them to the initialized Gemini model for processing.
7. **Run Application**: The application is run using Uvicorn on the specified host and port.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

# ... other imports

app = FastAPI()

# Define a chat request model
class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str

# Create a chat route
@app.post("/api/chat")
async def chat(request: ChatRequest):
    # Your code here to process the chat request
    # using the GoogleGenerativeAi model
    return {"response": "Chat response"}

# Run the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
