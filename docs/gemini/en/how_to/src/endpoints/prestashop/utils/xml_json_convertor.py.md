**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block defines a function named `presta_fields_to_xml` that converts a dictionary representing PrestaShop product fields to a valid XML string. The XML string is formatted with a fixed root name `prestashop` and includes the provided product data. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The function checks if the input dictionary `presta_fields_dict` is empty. If it is, an empty string is returned.
2. It obtains the first key from the dictionary, representing the type of product field (e.g., `product`, `category`).
3. It creates a root XML element named `prestashop` and a nested element with the name extracted from the dictionary key (e.g., `product`).
4. It iterates through the dictionary to build the XML structure.
5. If a key starts with '@', it is treated as an attribute of the current element.
6. If a key is '#text', it is treated as the text content of the current element.
7. If a key is a regular field, it is either added as a direct child element or a nested element with the appropriate structure if the value is a list or a nested dictionary.
8. The function then converts the XML structure to a string and returns it.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Example JSON data for PrestaShop product fields
    json_data = {
        "product": {
            "name": {
                "language": [
                    {"@id": "1", "#text": "Test Product"},
                    {"@id": "2", "#text": "Test Product"},
                    {"@id": "3", "#text": "Test Product"}
                ]
            },
            "price": "10.00",
            "id_tax_rules_group": "13",
            "id_category_default": "2"
        }
    }

    # Convert the JSON data to XML string
    xml_output = presta_fields_to_xml(json_data)

    # Print the generated XML
    print(xml_output)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
