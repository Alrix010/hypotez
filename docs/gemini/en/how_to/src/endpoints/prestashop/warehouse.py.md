**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code defines a `PrestaWarehouse` class, which inherits from the `PrestaShop` class. This class is designed to interact with a PrestaShop warehouse, likely for managing warehouse-related data or operations.  The `...` signifies that the class definition is not fully provided in the snippet. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports necessary modules, including `os`, `sys`, `attr`, `pathlib`, `header`, `gs`, `pprint`, `PrestaShop`, and `logger`. 
2. It defines the class `PrestaWarehouse`, which inherits from `PrestaShop`.
3. Inside the class definition, there are likely methods or attributes related to warehouse management. The `...` indicates that the code snippet shows only the beginning of the class definition.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Assuming the class is fully defined:
warehouse = PrestaWarehouse()  # Initialize the class

# Example of potential use:
warehouse.get_warehouse_details(warehouse_id=123)  # Example method to get details
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
