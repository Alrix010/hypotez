**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the `PrestaSupplier` Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `PrestaSupplier` class is a specialized class for interacting with PrestaShop suppliers. It extends the `PrestaShop` class, inheriting its functionality for working with the PrestaShop API. The `PrestaSupplier` class provides a convenient way to manage supplier-related operations within the project. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `PrestaSupplier` class is initialized by providing either a dictionary or a `SimpleNamespace` object containing the `api_domain` and `api_key` for accessing the PrestaShop API. Alternatively, these parameters can be provided directly during initialization. If the `api_domain` or `api_key` are not specified, a `ValueError` is raised.
2. **Inheritance**:  The `PrestaSupplier` class extends the `PrestaShop` class, so it inherits all methods and attributes from the parent class. This allows it to perform any API operations available through the `PrestaShop` class. 
3. **API Access**: After initialization, the `PrestaSupplier` object can be used to interact with the PrestaShop API using the inherited methods from the `PrestaShop` class.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.prestashop.supplier import PrestaSupplier

# Example 1: Using a dictionary for credentials
credentials = {
    "api_domain": "https://your-prestashop-domain.com",
    "api_key": "your-api-key"
}
supplier = PrestaSupplier(credentials=credentials)

# Example 2: Providing credentials directly
supplier = PrestaSupplier(api_domain="https://your-prestashop-domain.com", api_key="your-api-key")

# Example 3: Accessing inherited methods
response = supplier.get_products(id_supplier=1)
print(response)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
