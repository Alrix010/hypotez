**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a list named `resource` containing strings representing available resources for API calls in PrestaShop. These resources are used for making requests to the PrestaShop API to retrieve or modify data. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code initializes an empty list called `resource`.
2. It then appends a series of strings representing available resources to the list. Each string corresponds to a specific resource available through the PrestaShop API, such as "products," "categories," "customers," and more.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.prestashop.api_schemas.api_resourses_list import resource

# Get all available resources for the PrestaShop API
print(f"Available Resources: {resource}")

# Example usage:
for resource_name in resource:
    # Perform API calls for each resource
    # ...
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
