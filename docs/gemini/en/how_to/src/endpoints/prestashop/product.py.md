**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a class `PrestaProduct` that interacts with PrestaShop products. It provides methods for fetching product data, adding new products, and manipulating existing products through the PrestaShop API. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `PrestaProduct` class is initialized with API key and domain information, configured either through environment variables or from a config file.
2. **Schema Retrieval**: The `get_product_schema` method retrieves the schema for the product resource from PrestaShop, allowing for the retrieval of a specific product schema or the full schema. 
3. **Parent Category Retrieval**: The `get_parent_category` method retrieves the parent category of a given category ID from PrestaShop, allowing for traversing the category hierarchy.
4. **Parent Category Addition**: The `_add_parent_categories` method identifies and adds all unique parent categories for a list of category IDs to a `ProductFields` object, ensuring that all necessary categories are included.
5. **Product Retrieval**: The `get_product` method retrieves a product from PrestaShop based on its ID, providing a dictionary representation of the product's fields.
6. **Product Addition**: The `add_new_product` method creates a new product in PrestaShop using a `ProductFields` object, which encapsulates the product's data. It also uploads a default image for the product if provided.


Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from src.endpoints.prestashop.product import PrestaProduct, Config

# Initialize PrestaShop API client
p = PrestaProduct(API_KEY=Config.API_KEY, API_DOMAIN=Config.API_DOMAIN)

# Get a product by ID
product_data = p.get_product(id_product=2191)
print(product_data)

# Example of adding a new product
# product_fields = ProductFields(...)  # Populate the product fields object
# added_product = p.add_new_product(product_fields)
# print(f"New product added: {added_product}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
