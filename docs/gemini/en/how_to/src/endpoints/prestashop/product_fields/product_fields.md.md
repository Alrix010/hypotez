**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This JSON object represents a product structure for Prestashop. It provides a comprehensive set of fields that define the characteristics of a product, including basic information like product ID, reference, and price, as well as multi-language attributes like product name and description, associations with categories and images, and settings for availability, visibility, and stock management.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Prepare the JSON Object**:  Construct the JSON data structure by providing values for each required field. 
    - Remember to use valid Prestashop IDs for categories, manufacturers, suppliers, etc.
    - Define multi-language fields for each supported language in your shop.
    - Ensure that the format of data (integers, strings, booleans) is correct. 
2. **Send the JSON Object to Prestashop API**: Use a suitable HTTP client library (like `requests` in Python) to make a POST request to the Prestashop product creation endpoint. 
    - Include the appropriate authentication headers (API key) for access.
    - Set the content type to `application/json`.
    - Send the JSON data as the request body.
3. **Process the API Response**: Analyze the response code (201 for success) and check for error messages. If successful, the API will have created the product in Prestashop.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
import requests
import json

API_URL = "http://your-prestashop-domain/api/products" # Replace with your Prestashop API URL
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY" # Replace with your Prestashop API key

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Basic {API_KEY}"
}

data = {
  "product": {
    "id_default_combination": None,
    "id_tax_rules_group": "1",
    "reference": "REF-001",
    "quantity": "100",
    "price": "10.000000",
    "state": "1",
    "available_for_order": "1",
    "show_price": "1",
    "visibility": "both",
    "id_category_default": "2",
    "name": [
      {
        "language": {
          "id": "1"
        },
        "value": "New Product"
      }
    ],
    "description_short": [
      {
        "language": {
          "id": "1"
        },
        "value": "<p>Short description of the new product.</p>"
      }
    ],
    "link_rewrite": [
      {
        "language": {
          "id": "1"
        },
        "value": "new-product"
      }
    ]
  }
}

try:
    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
    response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for bad status codes
    print("Product created successfully!")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error creating product: {e}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
