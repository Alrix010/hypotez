**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block sets up a basic Python module structure for the file `src/endpoints/emil/presta.py`. It includes the standard header information, such as the file path, coding style, and interpreter specification, along with a basic module docstring.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `## \\file /src/endpoints/emil/presta.py` line indicates the file location within the `hypotez` project.
2. The `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` line specifies the character encoding for the file, which is UTF-8.
3. The `#! .pyenv/bin/python3` line indicates the Python interpreter to use for running the code.
4. The docstring using `"""..."""` provides a basic description of the module's purpose. It includes the module name, platform compatibility, and a synopsis of its functionality.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
## \file /src/endpoints/emil/presta.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! .pyenv/bin/python3

"""
.. module:: src.endpoints.emil.presta 
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis:

"""

# Add your code here to implement the functionality of this module

# Example function
def my_function():
    """
    This function demonstrates an example of code within this module.
    """
    print("Hello from Presta!")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
