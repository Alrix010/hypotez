**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block serves as the entry point for the `emil` endpoint in the `hypotez` project. It imports the `main` function from the `emil_design` module and executes it when the script is run directly.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports the `main` function from the `emil_design` module.
2. It checks if the script is being run directly (using `if __name__ == "__main__":`).
3. If the script is run directly, it calls the `main()` function.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from src.endpoints.emil.main import main

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
