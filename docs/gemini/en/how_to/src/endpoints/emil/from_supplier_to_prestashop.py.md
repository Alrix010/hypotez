How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a class called `SupplierToPrestashopProvider` which is responsible for processing and integrating product data from various suppliers into the Prestashop platform. The class utilizes a combination of web scraping, AI processing, and Prestashop API interactions to ensure accurate and efficient data transfer.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The class is initialized with configuration settings, a driver instance (for web scraping), an AI model (for data processing), and other necessary components.
2. **Data Gathering**: The `process_graber` method extracts product data from a specified supplier using a web scraper. This data is then converted into a standard format.
3. **AI Processing**: The `process_llm` method uses a Google Gemini AI model to enhance and improve the quality of the extracted product data. This includes tasks like text summarization, translation, and content generation.
4. **Prestashop Integration**: The `save_in_prestashop` method sends the processed product data to the Prestashop platform using its API. The class ensures that the data is accurately formatted and compatible with Prestashop's structure.
5. **Facebook Posting**: The `post_facebook` method is responsible for creating a Facebook post with information about the processed product. This includes the product's name, description, and pricing.
6. **Report Generation**: The `create_report` method creates a comprehensive report summarizing the processed product data. This report is formatted in both HTML and PDF formats for easy sharing and analysis.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Initialize the SupplierToPrestashopProvider class
supplier_to_prestashop = SupplierToPrestashopProvider(
    lang='he',
    gemini_api='your_gemini_api_key',
    presta_api='your_prestashop_api_key',
    presta_url='your_prestashop_url'
)

# Process product data from a supplier
product_data = supplier_to_prestashop.process_graber(
    urls=['https://www.example-supplier.com/product1', 'https://www.example-supplier.com/product2'],
    price='100.00',
    mexiron_name='My Product'
)

# Save the product data to Prestashop
supplier_to_prestashop.save_in_prestashop(product_data)

# Create a Facebook post
supplier_to_prestashop.post_facebook(mexiron=product_data)

# Generate a report
report_file_path = Path('report.pdf')
supplier_to_prestashop.create_report(data=product_data, lang='he', html_file='report.html', pdf_file=report_file_path)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
