**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `validate_person()` method validates a `TinyPerson` instance using OpenAI's LLM. It sends a series of questions to the `TinyPerson` instance, evaluates the responses, and returns a confidence score. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize the conversation:** The method starts by creating a list of messages for the conversation with OpenAI's LLM.
2. **Generate the prompt:** The method uses a template to create the initial prompt that instructs the LLM on how to interview the `TinyPerson`.
3. **Send the prompt to the LLM:** The method sends the initial prompt to the LLM and waits for the response.
4. **Iterate through the conversation:**  The method enters a loop that continues until the LLM sends a termination message or the conversation is terminated. In each iteration:
    - **Get questions from the LLM:** The method extracts the questions from the LLM's response.
    - **Ask the questions to the TinyPerson:** The method asks the questions to the `TinyPerson` instance and gets its responses.
    - **Send the responses to the LLM:** The method sends the responses to the LLM and waits for the next message.
5. **Evaluate the conversation:** The method checks the LLM's final message for a termination marker and retrieves the validation score and justification from the message.
6. **Return the results:** The method returns the confidence score and justification to the caller.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.validation import TinyPersonValidator
from tinytroupe.agent import TinyPerson

# Create a TinyPerson instance
person = TinyPerson("Alice", "Alice is a talented artist and a passionate advocate for environmental sustainability.")

# Validate the TinyPerson
score, justification = TinyPersonValidator.validate_person(person)

# Print the results
print(f"Validation score: {score:.2f}")
print(f"Justification: {justification}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
