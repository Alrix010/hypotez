**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code snippet defines a `Normalizer` class which handles the normalization of textual elements like passages and concepts. It leverages a pre-trained LLM to cluster similar elements into normalized categories. It provides methods for initializing the normalization process, performing normalization on a single element or a list of elements, and storing the normalized elements in a cache for subsequent re-use. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `Normalizer` class is initialized with a list of elements to be normalized, the desired number of normalized categories (`n`), and an optional flag for verbose output (`verbose`).
2. During initialization, the class identifies unique elements and stores them in a list. 
3. It then utilizes the `openai_utils` module to interact with the OpenAI API, sending a request to the LLM with a specific set of system and user messages constructed using templates and rendering configurations. 
4. The received LLM response is then parsed for a JSON structure that defines the mapping of normalized elements to their original elements.
5. The `normalize` method then performs the normalization process. It checks if an element has already been normalized by looking up the `normalizing_map` cache. If not, it sends another request to the LLM with the element(s) and previously generated normalized categories, obtaining the normalized elements.
6. The normalized elements are then stored in the `normalizing_map` cache, ensuring that future calls with the same element will return the cached result.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.extraction.normalizer import Normalizer

# Example list of elements
elements = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "pear", "grape", "apple", "pear"]

# Initialize the Normalizer with 3 normalized categories
normalizer = Normalizer(elements, n=3)

# Normalize a single element
normalized_element = normalizer.normalize("apple")
print(f"Normalized element: {normalized_element}")

# Normalize a list of elements
normalized_elements = normalizer.normalize(["banana", "grape", "pear"])
print(f"Normalized elements: {normalized_elements}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
