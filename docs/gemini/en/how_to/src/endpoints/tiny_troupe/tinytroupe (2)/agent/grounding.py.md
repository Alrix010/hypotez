**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a base class for semantic grounding connectors, which are components that allow an agent to ground its knowledge in external sources like files or web pages using semantic search (i.e., embeddings-based search). This specific implementation is based on the `VectorStoreIndex` class from the Llama-Index library. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `BaseSemanticGroundingConnector` class is initialized with a name (defaulting to "Semantic Grounding"). It stores documents and their corresponding names in `self.documents` and `self.name_to_document`, respectively. 
2. **Post-Initialization**: The `_post_init` method, called after initialization, creates a `VectorStoreIndex` object (`self.index`) to store the documents for semantic search. It also initializes `self.documents` and `self.name_to_document` if they were not provided during initialization.
3. **Adding Documents**: The `add_documents` method indexes a list of documents. It sanitizes the text of each document and associates them with their names. 
4. **Retrieving Relevant Documents**: The `retrieve_relevant` method retrieves documents relevant to a given target using the `VectorStoreIndex` object.
5. **Retrieving by Name**: The `retrieve_by_name` method retrieves documents associated with a specific name.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.agent.grounding import BaseSemanticGroundingConnector
from llama_index import Document

# Create a grounding connector
connector = BaseSemanticGroundingConnector()

# Add a document
document = Document("This is a sample document.")
connector.add_document(document, doc_to_name_func=lambda doc: "Sample Document")

# Retrieve relevant documents
relevant_documents = connector.retrieve_relevant("sample document", top_k=5)
print(relevant_documents)

# Retrieve documents by name
named_documents = connector.retrieve_by_name("Sample Document")
print(named_documents)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
