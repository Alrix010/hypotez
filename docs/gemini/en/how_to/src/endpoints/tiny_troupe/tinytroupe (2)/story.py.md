**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `TinyStory` class is a tool for generating stories based on interactions in TinyTroupe simulations. It allows users to create stories about either an agent or an environment, with customizable parameters for story length, purpose, and inclusion of omitted interactions. The class uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate narrative text based on the provided context. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**:
    - Create a `TinyStory` object, providing either an environment (`TinyWorld`) or an agent (`TinyPerson`) as input, along with a story purpose, optional initial context, and parameters for interaction inclusion.
2. **Start Story**:
    - Call the `start_story` method to initiate the story generation. This method uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate initial narrative text based on the provided purpose, requirements, and simulation interaction history. 
3. **Continue Story**:
    - Call the `continue_story` method to extend the story. It utilizes GPT-3 to generate a continuation of the story based on the existing narrative and additional requirements.
4. **Retrieve Current Story**:
    - Access the `current_story` attribute to retrieve the generated narrative.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.agent import TinyPerson
from tinytroupe.environment import TinyWorld
from tinytroupe.story import TinyStory

# Define a TinyPerson agent
agent = TinyPerson(name="Alice", role="explorer", purpose="Explore the forest.")

# Create a TinyStory object focused on the agent
story = TinyStory(agent=agent, purpose="Tell a story about Alice's adventures in the forest.")

# Start the story
start = story.start_story(requirements="Start a story about Alice encountering a talking squirrel.")

# Continue the story
continuation = story.continue_story(requirements="Continue the story with Alice befriending the squirrel.")

# Access the full generated story
print(story.current_story)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
