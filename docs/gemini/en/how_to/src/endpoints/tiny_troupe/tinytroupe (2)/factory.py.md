How to Use the TinyFactory Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `TinyFactory` class serves as a base class for various types of factories, simplifying system extensions, especially regarding transaction caching. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: A `TinyFactory` instance is initialized with an optional `simulation_id`. It automatically assigns a unique name to the factory.
2. **Factory Registry**: The factory is added to a global registry (`TinyFactory.all_factories`) to track all created factories. This ensures factory names remain unique.
3. **Simulation Association**:  If a factory is created in a "free" environment (without a simulation ID), the `set_simulation_for_free_factories` static method can later associate it with a specific simulation. 
4. **State Encoding and Decoding**: The `encode_complete_state` method provides a mechanism for serializing the factory's state, allowing it to be saved and restored. The `decode_complete_state` method handles deserialization.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.factory import TinyFactory

# Initialize a factory without a simulation ID
factory = TinyFactory()
print(f"Factory Name: {factory.name}") 

# Associate a factory with a simulation
simulation_id = "my_simulation"
factory.simulation_id = simulation_id
print(f"Factory Simulation ID: {factory.simulation_id}") 

# Encode the factory state
encoded_state = factory.encode_complete_state()
print(f"Encoded State: {encoded_state}")

# Decode the factory state
decoded_factory = TinyFactory()
decoded_factory.decode_complete_state(encoded_state)
print(f"Decoded Factory Name: {decoded_factory.name}")
```

**How to Use the TinyPersonFactory Class**

Description
-------------------------
The `TinyPersonFactory` class extends `TinyFactory` and specializes in generating `TinyPerson` instances. It uses OpenAI's LLM to create person descriptions based on provided context.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: A `TinyPersonFactory` instance is initialized with a `context_text` (used for generating person descriptions) and an optional `simulation_id`. It tracks the generated person descriptions to avoid duplicates.
2. **Generate Factories**: The `generate_person_factories` static method generates a list of `TinyPersonFactory` instances using a generic context text. It uses OpenAI's LLM to create person factory descriptions.
3. **Generate a TinyPerson**: The `generate_person` method creates a `TinyPerson` instance based on the factory's context and optional agent particularities. It uses OpenAI's LLM to generate person specifications and then creates a `TinyPerson` object with those specifications.
4. **Transactional Model Calls**: The `_aux_model_call` method handles calls to OpenAI's LLM within a transactional framework, ensuring consistent caching behavior.
5. **Agent Setup**: The `_setup_agent` method configures the generated `TinyPerson` with the specified characteristics from the LLM-generated specifications.


Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.factory import TinyPersonFactory

# Initialize a person factory with context
context_text = "The story takes place in a futuristic city."
person_factory = TinyPersonFactory(context_text)

# Generate a TinyPerson
person = person_factory.generate_person()

# Access information about the generated person
print(f"Person Name: {person.get('name')}")
print(f"Person Description: {person.get('description')}")
```
