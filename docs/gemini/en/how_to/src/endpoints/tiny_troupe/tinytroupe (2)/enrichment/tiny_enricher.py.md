**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `TinyEnricher` class enhances content based on specified requirements using OpenAI's language model. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes an instance of `TinyEnricher`. It sets the `use_past_results_in_context` flag, which determines whether previous results should be included in the context provided to the language model. It also initializes an empty list (`context_cache`) to store past results.
2. **Content Enrichment**: The `enrich_content` method takes requirements, content, and optional information as input. It constructs a dictionary with these parameters and uses it to create an initial set of messages for the OpenAI model. 
3. **OpenAI Interaction**: The method sends these messages to the OpenAI model using `openai_utils.client().send_message`,  retrieves the response message, and logs it.
4. **Code Extraction**: If a response message is received, it extracts the code block from the content using `utils.extract_code_block` and returns it. If no response is received, `None` is returned.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from tinytroupe.enrichment import TinyEnricher

    enricher = TinyEnricher()

    # Example requirements and content
    requirements = "Generate Python code to calculate the sum of two numbers."
    content = "Provide a function to sum two numbers."

    # Enrich the content
    result = enricher.enrich_content(requirements, content)

    # Print the result
    if result:
        print(f"Enriched code:\n{result}")
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
