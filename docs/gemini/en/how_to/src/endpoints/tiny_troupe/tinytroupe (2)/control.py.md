**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the Simulation Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Simulation` class provides mechanisms for managing and controlling the simulation execution. It allows for caching and checkpointing of the simulation state, enabling efficient and reproducible simulations. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: Create a `Simulation` object. 
2. **Begin Simulation**: Use the `begin()` method to start the simulation. This method initializes the simulation state and loads the cache file, if specified.
3. **Add Entities**: Add agents, environments, and factories to the simulation using the `add_agent()`, `add_environment()`, and `add_factory()` methods respectively.
4. **Execute Transactions**:  Use the `transactional()` decorator to make functions transactional. Transactions are encapsulated units of execution that can be cached and reused. 
5. **End Simulation**: Call the `end()` method to mark the end of the simulation. This method saves the current simulation state to the cache file, if any changes are made.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.control import Simulation, transactional

# Create a simulation
simulation = Simulation()

# Start the simulation
simulation.begin(cache_path='./my_simulation.cache.json', auto_checkpoint=True)

# Define a transactional function 
@transactional
def my_function(agent, environment):
    # ... perform actions on the agent and environment ...
    return result

# Create agents and environments 
# ... 

# Execute the function within the simulation
result = my_function(agent, environment) 

# End the simulation
simulation.end()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
