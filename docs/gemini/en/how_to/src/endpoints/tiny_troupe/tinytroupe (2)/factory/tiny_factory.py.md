**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `TinyFactory` class defines a base structure for various factories within the project. It primarily functions as a container for managing and accessing different factory instances. The key features include:

* **Centralized Factory Registry**: The `all_factories` dictionary stores all created factory instances for global access.
* **Initialization**: The `__init__` method creates a new factory instance with a unique name, assigns an optional simulation ID, and registers the instance in the global registry.
* **Simulation Association**: The `set_simulation_for_free_factories` method allows factories created without a specific simulation ID to be associated with a specific simulation scope.
* **Caching Mechanism**: The class provides methods for encoding and decoding the complete state of a factory, enabling transactional caching.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Factory Creation**: A new `TinyFactory` instance is created with an optional simulation ID.
2. **Factory Registration**: The newly created instance is added to the `all_factories` dictionary.
3. **Simulation Assignment (Optional)**: If a factory is created without a simulation ID, it can later be assigned to a simulation using `set_simulation_for_free_factories`.
4. **State Encoding/Decoding**: The `encode_complete_state` and `decode_complete_state` methods allow for serialization and deserialization of the factory's state, enabling transactional caching.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.factory import TinyFactory
from tinytroupe.simulation import Simulation

# Create a new simulation
simulation = Simulation("MySimulation")

# Create a new factory instance
factory = TinyFactory(simulation_id="MyFactory")

# Access the factory instance from the global registry
factory_from_registry = TinyFactory.all_factories["MyFactory"]

# Verify factory assignment to simulation
assert factory_from_registry.simulation_id == "MyFactory"

# Create a factory without simulation ID
free_factory = TinyFactory()

# Assign the free factory to the simulation
simulation.add_factory(free_factory)

# Verify the assignment
assert free_factory.simulation_id == "MySimulation"

# Encode the factory state
encoded_state = factory.encode_complete_state()

# Decode the state (for example, after retrieving from cache)
restored_factory = TinyFactory().decode_complete_state(encoded_state)

# Verify restoration
assert restored_factory.name == factory.name
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
