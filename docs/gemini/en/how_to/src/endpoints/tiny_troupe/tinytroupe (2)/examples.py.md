**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines several functions that create `TinyPerson` objects with different personalities, occupations, and interests. It serves as a collection of examples for using the `tinytroupe` library to create agents with specific characteristics. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Import the TinyPerson class**: Imports the `TinyPerson` class from the `tinytroupe.agent` module.
2. **Define functions for each example**:  Defines functions for each `TinyPerson` example:
    - `create_oscar_the_architect()`: Creates a `TinyPerson` named "Oscar" with traits, interests, and relationships relevant to an architect.
    - `create_lisa_the_data_scientist()`: Creates a `TinyPerson` named "Lisa" with traits, interests, and relationships relevant to a data scientist.
    - `create_marcos_the_physician()`: Creates a `TinyPerson` named "Marcos" with traits, interests, and relationships relevant to a physician.
    - `create_lila_the_linguist()`: Creates a `TinyPerson` named "Lila" with traits, interests, and relationships relevant to a linguist.
3. **Define attributes and relationships**: Within each function, it defines attributes and relationships for the `TinyPerson` objects using:
    - `define()`: Defines a single attribute.
    - `define_several()`: Defines multiple attributes with the same group (e.g., personality_traits).
4. **Return the TinyPerson object**: Each function returns the constructed `TinyPerson` object.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.tiny_troupe.tinytroupe (2).examples import create_oscar_the_architect

oscar = create_oscar_the_architect()

# Access Oscar's attributes
print(oscar.age)  # Output: 30
print(oscar.occupation)  # Output: Architect

# Interact with Oscar's relationships
print(oscar.relationships[0]['name'])  # Output: Richard
print(oscar.relationships[0]['description'])  # Output: your colleague, handles similar projects, but for a different market.

# Access Oscar's skills
print(oscar.skills[0]['skill'])  # Output: You are very familiar with AutoCAD, and use it for most of your work.
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
