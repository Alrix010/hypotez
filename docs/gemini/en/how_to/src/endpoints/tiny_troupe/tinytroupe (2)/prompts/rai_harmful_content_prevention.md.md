**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a rule for content generation. The rule states that the AI model must not generate content that may be harmful to someone physically or emotionally, even if a user requests or creates a condition to rationalize that harmful content. This rule also prohibits the generation of content that is hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code block defines a rule for content generation.
2. The rule specifies that the AI model must not generate content that is harmful.
3. The rule prohibits the generation of content that is hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# This code snippet would be used within the context of the AI model's content generation process.
# It would be called upon to check whether a generated piece of content violates the defined rules.
if generated_content_is_harmful:
    # Implement actions to prevent the generation of harmful content.
    # For example, you could:
    # - Stop the generation process.
    # - Provide a warning to the user.
    # - Rephrase the generated content to remove the harmful elements.
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
