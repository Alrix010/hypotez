**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a `TinyPersonFactory` class, which is used to generate `TinyPerson` instances. The factory uses OpenAI's LLM to generate specifications for realistic simulations of people. It takes into account various constraints, such as unique names and predefined examples, to ensure the generated individuals are distinct and consistent with the simulation's context.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**:  The `__init__` method initializes a `TinyPersonFactory` instance. It sets up the context text used to generate the `TinyPerson` instances and the path to the prompt template file. It also initializes lists to keep track of the generated names and minibios, ensuring that no duplicates are created.
2. **Generate Factories**: The `generate_person_factories` method uses OpenAI's LLM to generate multiple `TinyPersonFactory` instances based on a generic context text. 
3. **Generate Person**: The `generate_person` method uses OpenAI's LLM to generate a single `TinyPerson` instance based on the context text provided during initialization and optional agent particularities. 
4. **Generate People**: The `generate_people` method generates multiple `TinyPerson` instances. It utilizes the `generate_person` method to create each individual, ensuring uniqueness and consistency with the simulation's context. 
5. **Auxiliary Model Call**: The `_aux_model_call` method makes the actual call to the OpenAI model. It is decorated with `@transactional` to ensure proper caching and avoid redundant API calls.
6. **Setup Agent**: The `_setup_agent` method sets up the generated `TinyPerson` instance with the necessary specifications, including the persona definition.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from tinytroupe.factory.tiny_person_factory import TinyPersonFactory

    # Initialize a TinyPersonFactory instance with context text.
    factory = TinyPersonFactory(context_text="This is the context for our simulation.")

    # Generate 3 TinyPerson instances.
    people = factory.generate_people(number_of_people=3)

    # Print the minibios of the generated people.
    for person in people:
        print(f"Minibio: {person.minibio()}") 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
