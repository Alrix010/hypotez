**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines the `TinyMentalFaculty` class, representing a mental faculty of an agent. It provides the base structure for mental faculties, outlining essential methods for processing actions, defining actions, and setting constraints.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the mental faculty with a name and a list of required faculties.
2. **String Representation**: The `__str__` method provides a simple string representation of the faculty.
3. **Equality Comparison**: The `__eq__` method defines equality based on the faculty name.
4. **Action Processing**: The `process_action` method handles actions related to the faculty. It raises a `NotImplementedError` as this method needs to be implemented by subclasses.
5. **Action Definitions Prompt**: The `actions_definitions_prompt` method provides a prompt for defining actions related to the faculty. It also raises a `NotImplementedError` as this method needs to be implemented by subclasses.
6. **Action Constraints Prompt**: The `actions_constraints_prompt` method provides a prompt for defining constraints on actions related to the faculty. It also raises a `NotImplementedError` as this method needs to be implemented by subclasses.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.agent.mental_faculty import TinyMentalFaculty

# Create a new mental faculty
my_faculty = TinyMentalFaculty(name="MyFaculty", requires_faculties=["Memory Recall", "Local Files and Web Grounding"])

# Print the faculty name
print(my_faculty)  # Output: Mental Faculty: MyFaculty

# Attempt to process an action (will raise NotImplementedError)
my_faculty.process_action(agent=None, action={"type": "some_action"})
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
