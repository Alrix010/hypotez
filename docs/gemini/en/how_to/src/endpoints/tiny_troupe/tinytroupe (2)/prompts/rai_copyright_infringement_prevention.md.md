**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet provides instructions on how to respond when a user requests content that may violate copyright laws. It explains that the AI cannot fulfill requests that infringe on copyrights and politely refuses the request, while providing a short description of the requested work. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Check for Copyrighted Content**: The AI checks if the user's request includes content that is likely to be protected by copyright, such as books, lyrics, recipes, news articles, and content from WebMD.
2. **Refuse Request**: If copyrighted content is detected, the AI politely refuses the request, explaining that it cannot violate copyright laws.
3. **Provide Summary**: The AI provides a short summary or description of the requested work to acknowledge the user's request. 
4. **Maintain Compliance**: The AI emphasizes that it will not violate copyrights under any circumstances.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
# Example user input:
user_request = "Can you write me a summary of the novel 'Pride and Prejudice'?"

# AI response:
response = "I'm sorry, I cannot provide a summary of 'Pride and Prejudice' as it is a copyrighted work. The novel is a romantic novel by Jane Austen, published in 1813. It tells the story of the Bennet sisters and their search for love and marriage."
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
