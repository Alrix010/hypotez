**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the `Profiler` Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `Profiler` class provides mechanisms for understanding the characteristics of agent populations, such as their age distribution, typical interests, and so on. It analyzes a list of agents (represented as dictionaries) and calculates the distribution of specified attributes. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: Create a `Profiler` object, specifying the attributes to be profiled. For example, `Profiler(attributes=["age", "occupation", "nationality"])`.

2. **Profiling**: Use the `profile` method to analyze the provided agents. This method calculates the distribution of each specified attribute.

3. **Rendering**: Use the `render` method to visualize the profile results. This method generates a bar chart for each attribute distribution.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.agent import TinyPerson
from tinytroupe.profiling import Profiler

# Create a list of agents
agents = [
    TinyPerson(age=25, occupation="Software Engineer", nationality="American"),
    TinyPerson(age=30, occupation="Data Scientist", nationality="Canadian"),
    TinyPerson(age=25, occupation="Software Engineer", nationality="American"),
    TinyPerson(age=35, occupation="Teacher", nationality="British"),
]

# Create a profiler
profiler = Profiler(attributes=["age", "occupation", "nationality"])

# Profile the agents
profiler.profile(agents)

# Render the profile
profiler.render()

```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
