How to Use the `TinyTool` Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `TinyTool` class defines a base structure for specialized tools that agents can use to perform specific tasks. Each tool possesses unique characteristics such as name, description, ownership, potential real-world side effects, and optional capabilities for exporting and enriching results.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: A `TinyTool` object is created by providing essential attributes:
    - `name`: A descriptive name for the tool.
    - `description`: A brief summary of the tool's purpose.
    - `owner`: The agent that controls the tool (optional).
    - `real_world_side_effects`: Indicates if the tool has the capacity to alter real-world conditions (optional).
    - `exporter`: An `ArtifactExporter` object responsible for saving the tool's outputs (optional).
    - `enricher`: An `Enricher` object capable of enhancing the tool's results (optional).
2. **Action Processing**:  The `process_action` method orchestrates the execution of a tool's action. It performs the following:
    - **Real-World Side Effect Warning**: If the tool has real-world implications, a warning message is logged.
    - **Ownership Enforcement**: If the tool has an owner, the method verifies that the invoking agent is authorized to use it.
    - **Action Execution**: The `_process_action` method, which must be implemented by subclasses, carries out the tool's specific operation.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.tools import TinyTool
from tinytroupe.extraction import ArtifactExporter

# Create an exporter
exporter = ArtifactExporter()

# Define a custom tool 
class MyTool(TinyTool):
    def __init__(self, name, description):
        super().__init__(name, description, exporter=exporter)  # Pass the exporter
    
    def _process_action(self, agent, action: dict) -> bool:
        # Implement the tool's action logic here
        print(f"Agent {agent.name} is using tool {self.name} with action: {action}")
        return True

# Create an instance of the tool
my_tool = MyTool("MyCustomTool", "A tool for demonstration purposes.")

# Simulate an agent using the tool
agent =  # Your agent instance
action = {'type': 'CUSTOM_ACTION', 'content': 'some data'}

# Process the action
my_tool.process_action(agent, action) 
```

```
**Explanation of the Example:**

1. An `ArtifactExporter` instance is created to handle the tool's outputs.
2. A custom tool class `MyTool` inherits from `TinyTool`.
3. The `_process_action` method in `MyTool` implements the specific logic of the tool.
4. An instance of `MyTool` is created, and the exporter is provided during initialization.
5. An agent and action are simulated.
6. The `process_action` method on the tool instance is invoked, executing the defined logic.
