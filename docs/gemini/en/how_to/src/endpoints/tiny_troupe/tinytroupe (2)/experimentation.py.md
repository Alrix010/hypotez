**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use the ABRandomizer Class
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `ABRandomizer` class is a utility designed to randomize between two options (referred to as "A" and "B") and later de-randomize the choices. This randomization is useful for creating controlled experiments where participants are assigned to different groups ("A" or "B") without explicitly knowing their group.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: Create an instance of the `ABRandomizer` class. This requires providing real names for the two options (e.g., "control" and "treatment"), blind names used to present the options to the user (e.g., "A" and "B"), and a list of names that are not randomized (i.e., "passtrough names"). 
2. **Randomization**: Call the `randomize()` method to assign options "A" and "B" randomly to individuals.  This method internally stores the randomization mapping for each individual. 
3. **De-randomization**: Use the `derandomize()` method to recover the original options based on the stored randomization mapping.  This is necessary to analyze the results of the experiment and understand the true effects of the treatments.
4. **Derandomizing Names**: Utilize the `derandomize_name()` method to decode user choices based on the blind names and retrieve the corresponding real names.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Initialize the ABRandomizer
    randomizer = ABRandomizer(real_name_1="control", real_name_2="treatment", blind_name_a="A", blind_name_b="B")

    # Randomize choices for individuals
    choice_a, choice_b = randomizer.randomize(0, "control", "treatment") 
    
    # ... (Perform experiment using choice_a and choice_b) ...

    # Derandomize the choices after the experiment
    original_a, original_b = randomizer.derandomize(0, "control", "treatment")

    # Derandomize user choice
    user_choice = "A"
    real_choice = randomizer.derandomize_name(0, user_choice) 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
