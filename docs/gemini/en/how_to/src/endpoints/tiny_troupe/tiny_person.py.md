**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Create and Interact with a TinyPerson Agent
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet demonstrates how to create and interact with a `TinyPerson` agent using the `tinytroupe` library. It involves loading environment variables, creating an agent instance, defining characteristics, and interacting with the agent.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Load Environment Variables**:
    - The code first loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
    - This is done by importing the `dotenv` library and using the `load_dotenv()` function.
    - It then sets the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the value retrieved from the `.env` file.
2. **Create a TinyPerson Instance**:
    - An instance of the `TinyPerson` class is created with the name "John."
3. **Define Characteristics**:
    - Several characteristics are defined for the "John" agent, including age, occupation, nationality, and skills.
    - The `define()` method is used to add these characteristics to the agent's profile.
4. **Interact with the Agent**:
    - The code sends a message to the agent using the `listen()` method.
    - The agent then processes the message and performs an action using the `act()` method.
    - Finally, the code prints the current interactions using the `pp_current_interactions()` method.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# If the API key is stored in the .env file
load_dotenv()
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

from tinytroupe.agent import TinyPerson

# Create a TinyPerson instance
john = TinyPerson(name="John")

# Define some characteristics
john.define("age", 35)
john.define("occupation", "Software Engineer")
john.define("nationality", "American")
john.define("skills", [{"skill": "Coding in python"}])

# Interact with the agent
john.listen("Hello, John! How are you today?")
john.act()
john.pp_current_interactions()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
