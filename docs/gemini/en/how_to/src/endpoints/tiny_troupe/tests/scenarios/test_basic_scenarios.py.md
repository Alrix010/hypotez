**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code block implements two test functions, `test_basic_scenario_1` and `test_tool_usage_1`, to evaluate the functionality of TinyTroupe, a simulated agent environment. It showcases basic agent interactions, scenario management, and tool usage within the simulation.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The code imports necessary modules from TinyTroupe and initializes a logger for the test suite. 
2. **Test Scenario 1 (`test_basic_scenario_1`)**:
    - The test begins by resetting the TinyTroupe control, ensuring there are no active simulations.
    - It starts a new simulation using `control.begin()`.
    - An agent (`create_oscar_the_architect`) is created and defined with specific attributes like "age" and "nationality".
    - The simulation's execution and cached traces are verified for existence.
    - Two checkpoints are created during the simulation using `control.checkpoint()` to mark progress and potentially save data. 
    - The agent performs actions within the simulation:
        - `agent.listen_and_act("How are you doing??")` - The agent receives input and reacts to it within the simulation.
        - `agent.define("occupation", "Engineer")` - The agent defines its occupation.
    - The test ends the simulation using `control.end()`.
3. **Test Tool Usage (`test_tool_usage_1`)**:
    - The test defines an artifact exporter, an enricher, and a tool (`TinyWordProcessor`) for data processing.
    - An agent (`create_lisa_the_data_scientist`) is created and equipped with a mental faculty (`tooluse_faculty`) that utilizes the defined tool.
    - The agent receives a multi-line instruction and performs actions based on it.
    - The test verifies the presence of a specific action type (`WRITE_DOCUMENT`) within the agent's actions list.
    - It checks for the existence of files (`Resume.Lisa Carter.docx`, `Resume.Lisa Carter.json`, `Resume.Lisa Carter.md`) generated by the tool in a designated output folder.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from tinytroupe.control import Simulation
    # ... other imports

    def test_basic_scenario_1():
        # ... existing code 

        control.begin()
        assert control._current_simulations["default"].status == Simulation.STATUS_STARTED, "The simulation should be started at this point."

        agent = create_oscar_the_architect()

        # Define the agent's attributes 
        agent.define("age", 19)
        agent.define("nationality", "Brazilian")

        # Perform actions within the simulation
        agent.listen_and_act("How are you doing??")
        agent.define("occupation", "Engineer")

        control.end()
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
