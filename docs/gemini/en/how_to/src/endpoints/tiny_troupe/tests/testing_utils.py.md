**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a set of utility functions for testing Tiny Troupe simulations. These functions provide various checks and tools for verifying the behavior of agents and environments within simulations.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialize Environment:**
    - The code first initializes a TinyWorld environment named "Focus group" with three predefined agents: Lisa, Oscar, and Marcos.
2. **Set up Test Environment:**
    - Before running the test, the `setup()` fixture ensures a clean environment by clearing any existing agents and worlds.
3. **Execute Test Code:**
    - The `yield` keyword allows the test code to be executed within the fixture's scope.
4. **Clean Up:**
    - After the test execution, the fixture cleans up any temporary objects or files.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Import necessary modules
    import pytest
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.tiny_troupe.tests.testing_utils import focus_group_world

    @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
    def my_test_fixture(focus_group_world):
        # Access the focus_group_world fixture within your test
        world = focus_group_world
        # Perform your test logic using the world object
        print(f"World name: {world.name}")
        print(f"Agents: {world.agents}")
        assert world.name == "Focus group" 
        # ... your test code ...

    def test_my_function(my_test_fixture):
        # Your test function can now use the focus_group_world fixture
        # ... your test code ... 
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
