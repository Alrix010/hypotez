**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a unit test for the `TinyPersonFactory` class in the `tinytroupe` module. The test verifies that the factory can generate a person object with a minibio that is consistent with the provided specification.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The test function `test_generate_person` is executed.
2. A specification for a "banker" is defined, outlining their background and characteristics.
3. An instance of `TinyPersonFactory` is created using the "banker" specification.
4. The factory's `generate_person` method is called to create a new `Person` object.
5. The `minibio` method of the generated `Person` object is called to retrieve a short description.
6. The `proposition_holds` function is used to assert that the generated minibio is an acceptable description for someone working in banking.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
import pytest
from tinytroupe.factory import TinyPersonFactory

# Define a specification for a "programmer"
programmer_spec = """
A talented software engineer with a passion for open-source development.
"""

# Create a factory using the specification
programmer_factory = TinyPersonFactory(programmer_spec)

# Generate a new "programmer"
programmer = programmer_factory.generate_person()

# Print the programmer's minibio
print(programmer.minibio())
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
