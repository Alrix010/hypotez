How to Use This Code Block
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code snippet demonstrates the functionality of `TinyPersonValidator` in the `tinytroupe` project. It validates the characteristics of a TinyPerson object against user-defined expectations. The snippet creates two TinyPerson objects, a banker and a monk, and compares them against their respective expected traits. The code showcases how to use the `TinyPersonValidator.validate_person()` method to calculate a validation score and provide justification for the score.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Define Specifications**: The code defines specifications for the banker and monk characters. These specifications provide information about their backgrounds, roles, and personalities.
2. **Create TinyPerson Objects**: Using the `TinyPersonFactory`, the code creates two TinyPerson objects, one based on the banker specification and the other on the monk specification.
3. **Define Expectations**: Expected traits and characteristics of the banker and monk are defined as strings. These strings contain descriptions of the person's personality, wealth, intelligence, interests, and values.
4. **Validate TinyPerson**: The `validate_person()` method is used to compare the generated TinyPerson object against the defined expectations. The method calculates a score based on the match between the TinyPerson's attributes and the expectations.
5. **Analyze Validation Results**: The code prints the calculated score and justification for both the banker and monk. It then compares the monk's score against the wrong expectations (banker expectations) to showcase the impact of incorrect expectations on the validation process. 
6. **Assertions**: Finally, the code includes assertions to verify that the validation scores meet the expected criteria:
   - The banker score should be above 0.5, indicating a good match between the generated TinyPerson and its expectations.
   - The monk score should also be above 0.5, indicating a match with the monk's expectations.
   - The monk score with the wrong expectations should be below 0.5, signifying a mismatch.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Define expectations for a specific character
    character_expectations = """
    This person is:
    - Very creative
    - Enjoys solving problems
    - Works in the field of technology
    - Lives in a big city
    """
    # Create a TinyPerson object 
    character = TinyPersonFactory("A technology company in a major metropolis").generate_person("A software engineer")
    # Validate the character against the expectations
    score, justification = TinyPersonValidator.validate_person(character, expectations=character_expectations, include_agent_spec=False, max_content_length=None)
    print("Character score: ", score)
    print("Character justification: ", justification)
```
