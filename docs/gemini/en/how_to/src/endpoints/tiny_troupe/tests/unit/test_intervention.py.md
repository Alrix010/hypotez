**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code tests an intervention that modifies the behavior of an agent (Oscar) in a simulated world. The intervention sets a textual precondition (Oscar is not very happy) and defines an effect (change Oscar's thought to a happy one). The test verifies if the intervention successfully changes Oscar's behavior in the simulation.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Create an Agent**: An agent named Oscar is created with an initial thought about sadness. 
2. **Define an Intervention**: An intervention is defined with a textual precondition ("Oscar is not very happy") and an effect that changes Oscar's thought to a happy one.
3. **Create a Simulated World**: A world is created with Oscar and the intervention.
4. **Run the Simulation**: The simulation is run for two steps.
5. **Assert the Change in Behavior**: The test asserts that Oscar is talking about something happy after the intervention.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    # Create an agent
    oscar = create_oscar_the_architect()

    # Define an intervention
    intervention = Intervention(oscar) \
        .set_textual_precondition("Oscar is not very happy.") \
        .set_effect(lambda target: target.think("Enough sadness. I will now talk about something else that makes me happy."))

    # Create a world with the agent and intervention
    world = TinyWorld("Test World", [oscar], interventions=[intervention])

    # Run the simulation
    world.run(2)

    # Check the agent's behavior
    assert check_proposition(oscar, "Oscar is talking about something that brings joy or happiness to him.", last_n = 3)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
