**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code tests the `enrich_content` method of the `TinyEnricher` class. This method takes a set of requirements and existing content and generates enriched content that meets those requirements.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `test_enrich_content` function begins by defining the content to be enriched and a set of requirements for the enrichment.
2. It then creates a `TinyEnricher` object and calls the `enrich_content` method with the content, requirements, and context information.
3. The function then asserts that the result is not None, that the enriched content is at least three times larger than the original content in terms of characters, and logs the enrichment result.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from tinytroupe.enrichment import TinyEnricher
    
    content_to_enrich = """
