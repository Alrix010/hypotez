**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines several test functions for various utility functions within the `tinytroupe` package. These tests ensure the correct functionality of key utility functions like `extract_json`, `name_or_empty`, and `repeat_on_error`. Additionally, it demonstrates the usage of the `llm` decorator for interacting with large language models (LLMs). 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **`test_extract_json()`:** This function tests the `extract_json` utility, which attempts to extract JSON data from a given text string. It performs multiple assertions with different input strings, including cases with valid JSON, escaped characters, invalid JSON, and text with no JSON. 
2. **`test_name_or_empty()`:**  This function tests the `name_or_empty` utility, which returns the `name` attribute of an object if it exists; otherwise, it returns an empty string. It tests cases with a named object and a `None` object.
3. **`test_repeat_on_error()`:** This function tests the `repeat_on_error` decorator, which retries a function call a specified number of times if a specific exception occurs. It tests scenarios with retries and an exception, no exceptions, and exceptions not included in the specified exceptions list.
4. **`test_llm_decorator()`:** This function demonstrates the usage of the `llm` decorator, which interacts with an LLM to generate responses based on provided prompts. It showcases different examples of using the decorator with varying temperatures for text generation, restructuring feedback, abstracting rules, and rephrasing behavior. It also includes tests for functions expecting specific data types like boolean, float, and integer.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from tinytroupe.utils import extract_json, repeat_on_error, name_or_empty
from tinytroupe.utils.llm import llm

# Example of using extract_json
text = 'Some text before {"key": "value"} some text after'
result = extract_json(text)
assert result == {"key": "value"} 

# Example of using repeat_on_error
@repeat_on_error(retries=3, exceptions=[Exception])
def my_function():
    # Code that might raise an exception
    ... 

# Example of using the llm decorator
@llm(temperature=0.5)
def generate_text():
    return "Tell me a story." 

response = generate_text()
print(response)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
