**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a MishalsGPT provider for the g4f framework. It includes the provider's configuration, such as the API endpoint URL, supported models, and whether it supports streaming and requires authentication. It also defines the `_create_completion` function responsible for sending requests to the MishalsGPT API and retrieving completions. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. Defines the API endpoint URL (`url`), supported models (`model`), streaming support (`supports_stream`), and authentication requirement (`needs_auth`) for the MishalsGPT provider.
2. Defines the `_create_completion` function, which:
   - Takes the model name, messages, and stream flag as input.
   - Constructs a request payload with the model, temperature, and messages.
   - Sends a POST request to the API endpoint.
   - Retrieves the completion from the response and yields it as a stream.
3. Creates a parameter string describing the provider and its supported types using `get_type_hints` and `__code__.co_varnames`.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from g4f.Provider.Providers import Mishalsgpt

# Initialize the provider
provider = Mishalsgpt.Mishalsgpt()

# Example usage:
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"},
]

# Get a completion from the provider
completion = provider.create_completion(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
    messages=messages,
    stream=True
)

# Print the completion
print(completion)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
