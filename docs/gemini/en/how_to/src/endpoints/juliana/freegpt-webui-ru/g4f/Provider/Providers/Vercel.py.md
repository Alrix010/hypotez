**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet implements a `Vercel` provider for the `g4f` system, allowing users to access and utilize various language models hosted on Vercel's platform. It defines the supported models, their corresponding IDs, and handles authentication and communication with the Vercel API to execute model requests.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `Client` class is initialized, setting up a `requests` session with custom headers for communication with Vercel's API.
2. **Token Retrieval**: The `get_token()` method retrieves a token required for authenticating with Vercel's API by making a request to a specific URL and extracting the token from the response.
3. **Default Parameters**: The `get_default_params()` method retrieves the default parameters for a given model, providing a starting point for user-configurable settings.
4. **Model Generation**: The `generate()` method takes a model ID, a prompt, and optional parameters as input. It then combines the default parameters with the user-provided ones, constructs the request payload, and sends it to the Vercel API using a POST request. 
5. **Stream Handling**: The method implements a streaming mechanism using a `Queue` and threads to manage the response from the Vercel API. It yields individual tokens from the response as they become available, enabling real-time feedback.
6. **Completion Creation**: The `_create_completion()` function receives a model ID, messages, and stream flag, constructs a conversation string based on the messages, and utilizes the `generate()` method to obtain a completion. It yields individual tokens from the completion. 

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from g4f.Providers.Vercel import _create_completion
    
    model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    ]
    
    completion = _create_completion(model, messages, stream=False)
    
    for token in completion:
        print(token)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
