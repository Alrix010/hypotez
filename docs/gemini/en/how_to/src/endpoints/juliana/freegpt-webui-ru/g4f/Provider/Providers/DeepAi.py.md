**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The code snippet defines a function named `_create_completion`, which interacts with the DeepAi API to generate chat responses. It uses a custom API key generation method and sends a POST request with the user's messages as a JSON payload. The function returns a stream of responses, enabling real-time chat interaction.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `_create_completion` function receives the model name, chat messages, and stream flag as input.
2. It defines a helper function `md5` to calculate the MD5 hash of a given string.
3. It defines another helper function `get_api_key` that generates a unique API key using the user agent and a random number.
4. It sets up HTTP headers with the generated API key and user agent.
5. It prepares a file upload object containing the chat style (chat) and the chat history as a JSON string.
6. It makes a POST request to the DeepAi API endpoint `/chat_response` with the headers and files.
7. The function iterates through the streamed response and yields decoded chunks, enabling real-time chat interaction.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from g4f.Provider.Providers import DeepAi

model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
stream = True

response = DeepAi._create_completion(model_name, messages, stream)

for chunk in response:
    print(chunk)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
