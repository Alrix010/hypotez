**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `ChatgptLogin` class provides a basic implementation of the `Provider` interface for interacting with the ChatGPT API. It utilizes the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to the ChatGPT API and handles the necessary authentication and response parsing. 

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Fetch a nonce**: The code starts by retrieving a nonce value from the target website to be used for authentication. This involves making a request to the website, extracting the nonce from the response, and decoding it.
2. **Prepare the request**: The code then constructs the request payload and headers required for interacting with the ChatGPT API. This includes setting the API key, the model to use, and the user's message.
3. **Send the request**: The code sends a POST request to the ChatGPT API with the prepared payload and headers.
4. **Parse the response**: The response from the API is then parsed, and the extracted response is returned to the caller.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from g4f.Provider.Providers.ChatgptLogin import ChatgptLogin

provider = ChatgptLogin()
response = provider.create_completion(model='gpt-3.5-turbo', messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, world!'}], stream=False)

print(response)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
