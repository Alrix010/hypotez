**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block initializes a Flask application. It sets up the application's name and specifies the location of the HTML templates.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. **Imports Flask**: Imports the Flask framework from the `flask` module.
2. **Creates Flask App**: Instantiates a Flask application object named `app`.
3. **Sets Template Folder**: Configures the template folder for the Flask application to be located at `./../client/html`, indicating that the HTML templates are in a subdirectory relative to the current file.

Usage Example
-------------------------\

```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='./../client/html')
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
