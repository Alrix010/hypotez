**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet defines a `Website` class responsible for handling web requests and routing within a Flask application. It defines a series of routes for different URL paths, including the main page, chat pages, and asset file retrieval.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The `Website` class is initialized with a Flask application instance. 
2. It sets up routes for the application, defining the corresponding functions to handle different URL paths.
3. The `_chat` method handles chat URLs with conversation IDs, redirecting to the main chat page if the ID is invalid. It then renders the `index.html` template with the conversation ID.
4. The `_index` method handles the main chat page, generating a unique conversation ID and rendering the `index.html` template with it.
5. The `_assets` method handles requests for assets from the client folder, retrieving the requested file and sending it to the user.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from flask import Flask
from hypotez.src.endpoints.juliana.freegpt-webui-ru.server.website import Website

app = Flask(__name__)
website = Website(app)

# Registering the routes in the Flask app
for route, config in website.routes.items():
    app.add_url_rule(route, view_func=config['function'], methods=config['methods'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
