How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a class representing an Aichat provider for the G4F (Generative Flow Framework) library. The class provides an implementation for interacting with the Aichat chatbot API, allowing users to generate responses based on given messages.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code first imports necessary modules, including `os` for file system interactions, `requests` for making HTTP requests, and the `sha256` function for calculating hash values.
2. It defines basic parameters like the base URL for the Aichat API, the supported model (currently only "gpt-3.5-turbo"), whether the provider supports streaming responses, and whether it requires authentication.
3. The `_create_completion` function is the core of the provider. It constructs the request body by assembling the messages provided by the user and adds a prefix "assistant:" to indicate the expected response. 
4. It then defines headers for the HTTP request, including necessary security and user-agent information. 
5. The function constructs a JSON payload with the messages and other settings like temperature, presence penalty, top_p, and frequency penalty. 
6. It sends a POST request to the Aichat API endpoint with the prepared data and headers.
7. It then yields the message part of the received JSON response, representing the chatbot's response.
8. The `params` variable defines a string that describes the provider's capabilities, including the types of parameters accepted by the `_create_completion` function.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
    from g4f.Providers.Aichat import Aichat
    from g4f.Session import Session

    provider = Aichat()
    session = Session(provider=provider)
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    ]

    response = session.run(messages=messages)
    print(response)
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
