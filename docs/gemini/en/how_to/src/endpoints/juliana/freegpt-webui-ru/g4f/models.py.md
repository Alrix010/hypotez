**Instructions for Generating Code Documentation**

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the code snippet.

2. **Create a Step-by-Step Guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution Steps**: Describe the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage Example**: Provide a code example of how to use the snippet in the project.

3. **Example**:

How to Use This Code Block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a `Model` class with nested classes representing different language models. Each model class defines its name, base provider (like OpenAI or Hugging Face), and the recommended provider for using the model. It also defines a `ModelUtils` class that provides a dictionary mapping model names to their corresponding `Model` classes for easier access.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a `Model` class with nested classes representing different language models.
2. Each model class defines attributes like `name`, `base_provider`, and `best_provider`.
3. The `ModelUtils` class is defined with a `convert` dictionary that maps model names to their respective `Model` classes.

Usage Example
-------------------------

```python
from g4f import Provider
from g4f.models import Model, ModelUtils

# Access a model using its name
gpt_35_turbo_model = Model.gpt_35_turbo

# Get the recommended provider for the model
best_provider = gpt_35_turbo_model.best_provider

# Convert a model name to its corresponding Model class using ModelUtils
model_class = ModelUtils.convert['gpt-3.5-turbo']

# Use the model class to access model information
print(model_class.name)  # Output: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
print(model_class.base_provider)  # Output: 'openai'
```

4. **Avoid Vague Terms** like "getting" or "doing". Be specific about what the code does, for example: "checks", "validates", or "sends".
