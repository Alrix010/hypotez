# Provider for H2o.ai's Falcon and Llama Models

## Overview

This module provides a provider for interacting with H2o.ai's Falcon and Llama language models through their web API. The provider utilizes the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the H2o.ai server, allowing users to send prompts and receive responses from the models.

## Details

The module defines the following key components:

- **`url`**: The base URL for the H2o.ai API endpoint.
- **`model`**: A list of supported models, currently including `falcon-40b`, `falcon-7b`, and `llama-13b`.
- **`models`**: A dictionary mapping model names to their corresponding H2o.ai model IDs.
- **`_create_completion`**: A function responsible for sending prompts to the H2o.ai API and handling responses, including streaming support.

## Classes

### `class H2o`

**Description**: This class represents the provider for H2o.ai's Falcon and Llama models, handling interactions with the models through their web API.

**Attributes**:

- **`url`**: The base URL for the H2o.ai API endpoint.
- **`model`**: A list of supported models, currently including `falcon-40b`, `falcon-7b`, and `llama-13b`.
- **`supports_stream`**: Indicates whether the provider supports streaming responses from the model.
- **`needs_auth`**: Indicates whether the provider requires authentication to access the models.

**Methods**:

- **`_create_completion`**: Handles the creation of completions from the H2o.ai model, sending prompts and receiving responses.

## Functions

### `_create_completion`

**Purpose**: Sends a prompt to the H2o.ai API, using the specified model, and returns a generator that yields tokens of the response.

**Parameters**:

- **`model`**: The name of the H2o.ai model to use.
- **`messages`**: A list of messages in the conversation, each represented as a dictionary with keys `role` and `content`.
- **`stream`**: Boolean indicating whether to stream the response from the model.
- **`kwargs`**: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the H2o.ai API request, such as `temperature`, `truncate`, and `max_new_tokens`.

**Returns**:

- A generator that yields tokens of the model's response.

**Raises Exceptions**:

- **`requests.exceptions.RequestException`**: If an error occurs during the HTTP request.

**Inner Functions**: None

**How the Function Works**:

1. The function constructs a `conversation` string by concatenating the provided messages, along with the `instruction` prefix.
2. It creates a `Session` object from the `requests` library and sets necessary headers for the API request.
3. It makes a POST request to the `/settings` endpoint to set initial configuration for the conversation.
4. It makes a POST request to the `/conversation` endpoint to create a new conversation with the selected model.
5. It extracts the `conversationId` from the response.
6. It makes a POST request to the `/conversation/{conversationId}` endpoint, sending the constructed `conversation` string and `parameters` as JSON data.
7. The function iterates over the `completion` object's `iter_lines` generator and yields each line as a token.
8. If the token is `<|endoftext|>` it breaks the loop.

**Examples**:

```python
>>> from g4f.Provider.Providers.H2o import H2o
>>> provider = H2o()
>>> model = 'falcon-40b'
>>> messages = [
...     {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, how are you?'},
...     {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'I am doing well, thank you for asking.'}
... ]
>>> for token in provider._create_completion(model, messages, stream=False, temperature=0.7):
...     print(token)
...
I am doing well, thank you for asking. How can I help you today?
