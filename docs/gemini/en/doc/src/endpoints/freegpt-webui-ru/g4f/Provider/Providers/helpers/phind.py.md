# Phind Provider Helper Module

## Overview

This module provides a helper function for interacting with the Phind API, specifically for generating responses based on user prompts. It leverages the `requests` library for making HTTP requests and handles JSON data serialization/deserialization.

## Details

This file defines the `output()` function, which is responsible for processing the streamed responses received from the Phind API. It parses the data, decodes it from bytes to strings, and outputs the relevant parts to the console. The module also includes code for sending a POST request to the Phind API endpoint, passing user prompt and other relevant information in the request body.

## Functions

### `output(chunk)`

**Purpose**: Processes chunks of streamed data received from the Phind API. Extracts relevant information from the data, decodes it, and prints it to the console.

**Parameters**:

- `chunk` (bytes): A chunk of data received from the Phind API.

**Returns**: None.

**Raises Exceptions**:

- `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError`: If an error occurs during JSON decoding.

**How the Function Works**:

1. The function first checks if the chunk contains metadata related to Phind, indicated by the presence of `b'PHIND_METADATA'`. If it does, it does nothing and returns.

2. If the chunk contains empty data (such as `b'data:  \\r\\ndata: \\r\\ndata: \\r\\n\\r\\n'`), it's replaced with `b'data:  \\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'`.

3. The function then attempts to decode the chunk from bytes to a string. If successful, it performs the following replacements:
    - Replaces `'data: \\r\\n\\r\\ndata: '` with `'data: \\n'`.
    - Replaces `'\\r\\ndata: \\r\\ndata: \\r\\n\\r\\n'` with `'\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'`.
    - Removes `'data: '` and `'\\r\\n\\r\\n'` from the string.

4. The decoded and processed string is then printed to the console, ensuring that the output is flushed immediately.

5. If the decoding fails, the function catches the `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError` and ignores the error.

**Examples**:

```python
# Example 1: Processing a chunk containing relevant data
chunk = b'data: Some text data\\r\\n\\r\\n'
output(chunk)

# Output:
# Some text data

# Example 2: Processing a chunk containing empty data
chunk = b'data:  \\r\\ndata: \\r\\ndata: \\r\\n\\r\\n'
output(chunk)

# Output:
# (No output as the chunk is empty)
```

## Inner Functions: None

## Parameter Details:

- `chunk` (bytes): A chunk of data received from the Phind API. This data can be in the form of a JSON object or a string, and it represents a portion of the overall response.

## Examples:

```python
# Example 1: Using the output function to process a chunk of data
chunk = b'data: Some text data\\r\\n\\r\\n'
output(chunk)

# Example 2: Sending a POST request to the Phind API
prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
json_data = json.dumps({'question': prompt, 'options': {'skill': 'intermediate', 'date': datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%d/%m/%Y'), 'language': 'en', 'detailed': True, 'creative': True, 'customLinks': []}}, separators=(',', ':'))
headers = { ... }
response = requests.post('https://www.phind.com/api/infer/answer', headers=headers, data=json_data, content_callback=output, timeout=999999, impersonate='safari15_5')
```
