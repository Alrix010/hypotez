# Module: `hypotez/src/endpoints/bots/telegram/digital_market/bot/migration/versions/47f559ec82bb_initial_revision.py`

## Overview

This module defines the initial revision for the Alembic database migration system. It sets up the initial state of the database schema, including the revision identifier and the upgrade and downgrade functions.

## Details

This file is part of the database migration system for the `hypotez` project. It contains the initial revision for the database schema. The revision ID is `47f559ec82bb` and it is used by Alembic to track changes to the database schema.

## Classes

### `upgrade`

**Description**: The `upgrade` function performs the initial schema changes for the database.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Raises Exceptions**: None

**How the Function Works**:

The `upgrade` function is called by Alembic to apply the initial schema changes. This function typically contains commands to create tables, columns, indexes, and other database objects. 

**Example**:

```python
def upgrade() -> None:
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    pass
    # ### end Alembic commands ###
```

### `downgrade`

**Description**: The `downgrade` function reverts the changes made by the `upgrade` function.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Raises Exceptions**: None

**How the Function Works**:

The `downgrade` function is called by Alembic to undo the changes made by the `upgrade` function. This function typically contains commands to drop tables, columns, indexes, and other database objects. 

**Example**:

```python
def downgrade() -> None:
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    pass
    # ### end Alembic commands ###
```

## Parameter Details

- `revision` (str): Revision identifier for the current database schema.
- `down_revision` (Union[str, None]): Revision identifier of the previous schema version, or `None` if this is the initial revision.
- `branch_labels` (Union[str, Sequence[str], None]): Branch labels for the current revision.
- `depends_on` (Union[str, Sequence[str], None]): List of revisions that this revision depends on.
