# Module for Environment Configuration and Migrations

## Overview

This module defines the environment configuration and migration logic for the Telegram bot, specifically for the digital market's migration process. It handles setting up database connections, configuring the environment, and running database migrations.

## Details

This module is crucial for managing the database structure and its updates during the migration process. It ensures the bot's database is consistent and synchronized with the latest schema changes.

## Functions

### `run_migrations_offline()`

**Purpose**: Runs migrations in offline mode, which means it doesn't require an active database connection. This mode is useful for testing or scenarios where a database is not immediately available.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Raises Exceptions**: None

**How the Function Works**:

1. Retrieves the database URL from the configuration.
2. Configures the migration context with the URL, target metadata, and other options.
3. Starts a transaction.
4. Executes the migrations using the `context.run_migrations()` function.

### `do_run_migrations(connection)`

**Purpose**: Runs migrations using an existing database connection. This function is typically called from within a transaction to ensure data consistency.

**Parameters**:

- `connection` (`sqlalchemy.engine.Connection`): An active database connection object.

**Returns**: None

**Raises Exceptions**: None

**How the Function Works**:

1. Configures the migration context with the provided connection and target metadata.
2. Starts a transaction.
3. Executes the migrations using the `context.run_migrations()` function.

### `run_async_migrations()`

**Purpose**: Runs migrations asynchronously using an asynchronous database engine. This function is designed for environments where asynchronous operations are preferred.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Raises Exceptions**: None

**How the Function Works**:

1. Creates an asynchronous engine from the configuration, using a `pool.NullPool` to avoid connection pooling.
2. Connects to the database using `connectable.connect()`.
3. Executes the migrations synchronously within the connection using `connection.run_sync(do_run_migrations)`.
4. Disposes of the engine to release resources.

### `run_migrations_online()`

**Purpose**: Runs migrations in online mode, which means it connects to the database and executes the migrations directly. This mode is typically used for production environments where a database is readily accessible.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Raises Exceptions**: None

**How the Function Works**:

1. Executes the `run_async_migrations()` function to run migrations asynchronously.

## Parameter Details

- `database_url` (`str`): This is the database connection string, formatted according to the chosen database dialect. It's typically obtained from environment variables or configuration files.

## Examples

```python
# Example usage of the `run_migrations_offline()` function
run_migrations_offline()

# Example usage of the `run_migrations_online()` function
run_migrations_online()

# Example of configuring the migration context
context.configure(
    url="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database",
    target_metadata=target_metadata,
    literal_binds=True,
    dialect_opts={"paramstyle": "named"},
)

# Example of running migrations within a transaction
with context.begin_transaction():
    context.run_migrations()
```

## Class Methods

- `run_async_migrations()`: Runs migrations asynchronously using an asynchronous database engine. 

**Parameters**: # if there are parameters
