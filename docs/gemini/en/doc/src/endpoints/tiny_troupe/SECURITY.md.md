# SECURITY.md

## Overview

This file outlines the security policy and reporting process for vulnerabilities found in Microsoft-owned repositories on GitHub.

## Details

Microsoft takes the security of its software products and services seriously. This includes all source code repositories managed through its GitHub organizations, including [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet), [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet), and [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin).

## Reporting Security Issues

**It is crucial to report security vulnerabilities through designated channels and not through public GitHub issues.**

Please report vulnerabilities to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/create-report).

Alternatively, you can send an email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com). If possible, encrypt your message with Microsoft's PGP key, which can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/pgp).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If you don't, please follow up via email to ensure the initial message was received. Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc). 

To facilitate the evaluation process, please provide as much information as possible:

* **Type of issue**: (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* **Full paths of source file(s)**: related to the vulnerability
* **Location of the affected source code**: (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* **Special configuration**: required to reproduce the issue
* **Step-by-step instructions**: to reproduce the issue
* **Proof-of-concept or exploit code**: (if possible)
* **Impact of the issue**: including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help triage your report more quickly. For bug bounty submissions, complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. Visit the [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/bounty) page for details.

## Preferred Language

For all communications, English is preferred.

## Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://aka.ms/security.md/cvd).
