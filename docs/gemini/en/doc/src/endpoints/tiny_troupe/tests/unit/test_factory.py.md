# Module Name: `hypotez/src/endpoints/tiny_troupe/tests/unit/test_factory.py`

## Overview

This module contains unit tests for the `TinyPersonFactory` class, which is responsible for generating tiny person objects with specific characteristics and personality traits. 

## Details

The module focuses on testing the generation process of tiny person objects using the `TinyPersonFactory` class. It creates a specific character specification (`banker_spec`) and utilizes the factory to generate a tiny person instance based on that specification. The generated minibio is then evaluated against a natural language proposition using an LLM to ensure its coherence and consistency with the provided specification.

## Functions

### `test_generate_person`

**Purpose**: This function tests the `TinyPersonFactory.generate_person()` method by creating a banker character specification, generating a tiny person instance based on it, and verifying the generated minibio using an LLM.

**Parameters**:

- `setup`:  A pytest fixture setup for the test.

**Returns**:

- `None`.

**Raises Exceptions**:

- `AssertionError`: If the LLM evaluation of the generated minibio does not hold true for the provided proposition.

**Example**:

```python
def test_generate_person(setup):
    banker_spec ="""
    A vice-president of one of the largest brazillian banks. Has a degree in engineering and an MBA in finance. 
    Is facing a lot of pressure from the board of directors to fight off the competition from the fintechs.    
    """

    banker_factory = TinyPersonFactory(banker_spec)

    banker = banker_factory.generate_person()

    minibio = banker.minibio()

    assert proposition_holds(f"The following is an acceptable short description for someone working in banking: '{minibio}'"), f"Proposition is false according to the LLM."
```

**How the Function Works**:

1. **Character Specification:**  The function defines a character specification (`banker_spec`) that describes a banker's profile, including their role, education, and current challenges.

2. **Tiny Person Factory:**  It creates an instance of the `TinyPersonFactory` class, passing the `banker_spec` as an argument. This factory is designed to generate tiny person objects based on provided specifications.

3. **Tiny Person Generation:**  The function calls the `generate_person()` method of the `TinyPersonFactory` to create a tiny person instance (`banker`) based on the provided specification.

4. **Minibio Retrieval:**  It retrieves the `minibio` of the generated `banker` instance. The minibio is a short description of the character.

5. **LLM Evaluation:**  The function uses an LLM to evaluate the `minibio` against a natural language proposition. The proposition asserts that the minibio is an acceptable description for someone working in banking.

6. **Assertion**:  The function uses an assertion (`assert proposition_holds(...)`) to check if the LLM evaluation of the minibio matches the provided proposition. If the proposition is not satisfied, the test fails with an `AssertionError`.

**Examples**:

- The example code demonstrates a basic scenario where the `test_generate_person` function is executed with a specific character specification. 
- The function aims to ensure that the generated minibio for the banker character aligns with the provided description and satisfies the LLM-based proposition. 
- This test helps verify that the `TinyPersonFactory` produces coherent and consistent character descriptions based on the provided specifications.
