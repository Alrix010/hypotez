# Module for Setting Default Headers in `gpt4free` Requests

## Overview

This module defines default headers for requests to the `gpt4free` API. It includes the `DEFAULT_HEADERS` dictionary for general requests and the `WEBVIEW_HAEDERS` dictionary for webview-specific requests. 

## Details

The code utilizes the `brotli` library for compression if available, otherwise it uses `gzip` and `deflate`. The headers are designed to mimic a typical user agent, including information about the operating system, browser, and language preferences. These headers are crucial for ensuring successful communication with the `gpt4free` API.

## Examples

```python
# Example usage of the DEFAULT_HEADERS dictionary
import requests

headers = DEFAULT_HEADERS
headers["referer"] = "https://www.example.com"

response = requests.get("https://www.example.com", headers=headers)

print(response.text)

# Example usage of the WEBVIEW_HAEDERS dictionary
import requests

headers = WEBVIEW_HAEDERS
headers["Referer"] = "https://www.example.com"

response = requests.get("https://www.example.com", headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```
