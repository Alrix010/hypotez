# Module `Aura.py`

## Overview

This module implements the `Aura` class, which is an asynchronous generator provider for interacting with the `openchat.team` service. It allows sending messages to the service and asynchronously processing responses. The module is designed to work with aiohttp for making asynchronous HTTP requests and supports the use of proxies. The module extracts arguments from a browser instance.

## More details

This module is part of the `gpt4free` providers in the `hypotez` project and provides an interface for interacting with the `openchat.team` service. It is used to send a series of messages to the service and asynchronously process the responses.
The `Aura` class inherits from `AsyncGeneratorProvider`, allowing it to asynchronously yield message chunks as they are received from the service. It constructs HTTP POST requests to the service's API endpoint and streams the response back to the caller.

## Classes

### `Aura`

**Description**:
The `Aura` class is an asynchronous generator provider for interacting with the `openchat.team` service.
It inherits from `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and implements the logic for sending messages and asynchronously processing responses.

**Inherits**:
- `AsyncGeneratorProvider`: Provides a base class for asynchronous generator-based providers.

**Attributes**:
- `url` (str): The base URL of the `openchat.team` service (`https://openchat.team`).
- `working` (bool): Indicates whether the provider is currently working (set to `False`).

**Methods**:
- `create_async_generator()`: Creates an asynchronous generator that sends messages to the `openchat.team` service and yields the responses.

## Class Methods

### `create_async_generator`

```python
@classmethod
async def create_async_generator(
    cls,
    model: str,
    messages: Messages,
    proxy: str = None,
    temperature: float = 0.5,
    max_tokens: int = 8192,
    webdriver = None,
    **kwargs
) -> AsyncResult:
    """ Function creates an asynchronous generator that sends messages to the `openchat.team` service and yields the responses.
    Args:
        cls (Type[Aura]): The class itself (`Aura`).
        model (str): The model name (not used in the function body, but required by the interface).
        messages (Messages): A list of messages to be sent to the service.
        proxy (str, optional): The proxy URL to be used for the connection. Defaults to `None`.
        temperature (float, optional): The temperature setting for the model. Defaults to 0.5.
        max_tokens (int, optional): The maximum number of tokens in the response. Defaults to 8192.
        webdriver: web driver instance
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

    Returns:
        AsyncResult: An asynchronous generator that yields message chunks.

    Raises:
        aiohttp.ClientError: If there is an error during the HTTP request.
        Exception: If any other error occurs during the process.
    """
```

**Parameters**:
- `cls` (Type[`Aura`]): The class itself (`Aura`).
- `model` (str): The model name (not used in the function body but required by the interface).
- `messages` (`Messages`): A list of messages to be sent to the service.
- `proxy` (str, optional): The proxy URL to be used for the connection. Defaults to `None`.
- `temperature` (float, optional): The temperature setting for the model. Defaults to 0.5.
- `max_tokens` (int, optional): The maximum number of tokens in the response. Defaults to 8192.
- `webdriver`: web driver instance
- `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments.

**How the function works**:

1. **Preparation**:
   - The function extracts arguments from a browser instance.
   - It filters system messages from the list of messages.
   - It forms the data payload for the POST request, including model settings, messages, key, prompt, and temperature.
2. **Sending a Request**:
   - An asynchronous `aiohttp.ClientSession` is created.
   - An HTTP POST request is sent to the `openchat.team` service's API endpoint.
3. **Processing the Response**:
   - The function iterates over the response content in chunks.
   - Each chunk is decoded and yielded, allowing for asynchronous processing of the response.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the HTTP response has an error status, `response.raise_for_status()` raises an exception.
   - Errors during the HTTP request are caught and logged.

**Examples**:

Example call:

```python
# Assuming messages is a list of message dictionaries
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
]
# Create async generator
async_gen = Aura.create_async_generator(model="openchat_3.6", messages=messages, proxy="http://your-proxy:8080")
# Use async generator to get responses
async for chunk in async_gen:
    print(chunk)
