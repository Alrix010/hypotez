# CreateImagesProvider Module

## Overview

This module provides the `CreateImagesProvider` class, which extends the `BaseProvider` class and enables image generation within a conversational context. The provider detects image creation prompts within messages, processes them using a provided image generation function, and integrates the generated images into the output.

## Details

The `CreateImagesProvider` class is designed to enhance conversational AI systems by adding image generation capabilities. It functions as a wrapper around a base provider (e.g., a language model) and handles the specific task of creating images based on text prompts embedded within the user's messages.

## Classes

### `CreateImagesProvider`

**Description:**

Provider class for creating images based on text prompts. This provider handles image creation requests embedded within message content, using provided image creation functions.

**Inherits:**

    - `BaseProvider`

**Attributes:**

- `provider (ProviderType)`: The underlying provider to handle non-image related tasks.
- `create_images (callable)`: A function to create images synchronously.
- `create_images_async (callable)`: A function to create images asynchronously.
- `system_message (str)`: A message that explains the image creation capability.
- `include_placeholder (bool)`: Flag to determine whether to include the image placeholder in the output.
- `__name__ (str)`: Name of the provider.
- `url (str)`: URL of the provider.
- `working (bool)`: Indicates if the provider is operational.
- `supports_stream (bool)`: Indicates if the provider supports streaming.


**Methods:**

- `__init__(provider: ProviderType, create_images: callable, create_async: callable, system_message: str = system_message, include_placeholder: bool = True) -> None`

    **Purpose**: Initializes the `CreateImagesProvider`.

    **Parameters**:

    - `provider (ProviderType)`: The underlying provider.
    - `create_images (callable)`: Function to create images synchronously.
    - `create_async (callable)`: Function to create images asynchronously.
    - `system_message (str, optional)`: System message to be prefixed to messages. Defaults to a predefined message.
    - `include_placeholder (bool, optional)`: Whether to include image placeholders in the output. Defaults to True.

    **Returns**:

    - `None`
- `create_completion(model: str, messages: Messages, stream: bool = False, **kwargs) -> CreateResult`

    **Purpose**: Creates a completion result, processing any image creation prompts found within the messages.

    **Parameters**:

    - `model (str)`: The model to use for creation.
    - `messages (Messages)`: The messages to process, which may contain image prompts.
    - `stream (bool, optional)`: Indicates whether to stream the results. Defaults to False.
    - `**kwargs`: Additional keywordarguments for the provider.

    **Yields**:

    - `CreateResult`: Yields chunks of the processed messages, including image data if applicable.
- `create_async(model: str, messages: Messages, **kwargs) -> str`

    **Purpose**: Asynchronously creates a response, processing any image creation prompts found within the messages.

    **Parameters**:

    - `model (str)`: The model to use for creation.
    - `messages (Messages)`: The messages to process, which may contain image prompts.
    - `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments for the provider.

    **Returns**:

    - `str`: The processed response string, including asynchronously generated image data if applicable.
