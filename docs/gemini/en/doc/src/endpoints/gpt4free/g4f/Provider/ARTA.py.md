# ARTA Provider for GPT4Free
## Overview

This module provides an implementation of the `ARTA` class, representing a provider for image generation through the `ai-arta.com` API. This provider is designed to be compatible with the GPT4Free framework and leverages the `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and `ProviderModelMixin` base classes to simplify the integration and ensure asynchronous image generation.

## Details

The `ARTA` class implements the `AsyncGeneratorProvider` interface for handling image generation as an asynchronous process. It also utilizes the `ProviderModelMixin` mixin to provide common model management functionality. The provider offers a collection of models (e.g., "Flux," "Medieval," "Vincent Van Gogh," etc.) for generating images based on different styles. It establishes a connection to the `ai-arta.com` API and provides methods for authenticating, refreshing tokens, and generating images. The `create_async_generator` method orchestrates the process of generating images, retrieving status updates, and yielding results as an asynchronous generator.

## Classes

### `ARTA`

**Description**: This class represents the provider for generating images using the `ai-arta.com` API.

**Inherits**: 
    - `AsyncGeneratorProvider`: This class inherits from the `AsyncGeneratorProvider` base class, which provides the foundation for asynchronous image generation. 
    - `ProviderModelMixin`: This class inherits from the `ProviderModelMixin` mixin, which adds common model management functionality, enabling the provider to work with various models.

**Attributes**:

    - `url`: The base URL of the `ai-arta.com` API.
    - `auth_url`: The URL for obtaining authentication tokens.
    - `token_refresh_url`: The URL for refreshing authentication tokens.
    - `image_generation_url`: The URL for submitting image generation requests.
    - `status_check_url`: The URL for checking the status of image generation requests.
    - `working`: A boolean indicating whether the provider is currently operational.
    - `default_model`: The default image generation model.
    - `default_image_model`: The default image generation model (same as `default_model`).
    - `model_aliases`: A dictionary mapping model names to their corresponding aliases.
    - `image_models`: A list of available image generation models.
    - `models`: A list of available models (same as `image_models`).

**Methods**:

    - `get_auth_file()`: This method retrieves the path to the authentication file, which stores authentication tokens for the provider.
    - `create_token(path: Path, proxy: str | None = None)`: This method handles the process of generating authentication tokens. It sends a request to the `auth_url` with a specific payload and retrieves an authentication token from the response.
    - `refresh_token(refresh_token: str, proxy: str = None) -> tuple[str, str]`: This method refreshes the authentication token using the refresh token. It sends a request to the `token_refresh_url` with a specific payload and retrieves a new authentication token and refresh token.
    - `read_and_refresh_token(proxy: str | None = None) -> str`: This method retrieves the current authentication token from the authentication file or generates a new one if needed. If the existing token is close to expiring, it refreshes the token.
    - `create_async_generator(model: str, messages: Messages, proxy: str = None, prompt: str = None, negative_prompt: str = "blurry, deformed hands, ugly", n: int = 1, guidance_scale: int = 7, num_inference_steps: int = 30, aspect_ratio: str = "1:1", seed: int = None, **kwargs) -> AsyncResult`: This method creates an asynchronous generator for generating images. It takes various parameters (including the model, prompt, negative prompt, number of images, etc.) and initiates the image generation process. The generator yields status updates and the generated images as they become available.
