# OpenAI API Provider

## Overview

This module provides a class `OpenaiAPI` that implements the `OpenaiTemplate` interface. It is responsible for interacting with the OpenAI API, including authentication and data access. The `OpenaiAPI` class encapsulates the necessary logic and settings for working with the OpenAI platform.

## Details

The module utilizes the `OpenaiTemplate` class as a base, inheriting its properties and methods for generic API interactions. The `OpenaiAPI` class specifically defines attributes related to OpenAI's platform, including the base URL, login URL, and API endpoint. It also includes flags indicating whether the provider is currently active and requires authentication.

This module is designed to be integrated with the `hypotez` project and serves as a provider for accessing OpenAI's services. It provides a standardized and reusable way to interact with the OpenAI platform, ensuring consistency and maintainability in code.

## Classes

### `OpenaiAPI`

**Description**: This class represents the OpenAI API provider, implementing the `OpenaiTemplate` interface and providing specific settings and methods for interacting with the OpenAI platform.

**Inherits**: `OpenaiTemplate`

**Attributes**:

- `label` (str): A descriptive label for the provider, set to "OpenAI API".
- `url` (str): The base URL of the OpenAI platform.
- `login_url` (str): The URL for the OpenAI API key settings page.
- `api_base` (str): The base URL for the OpenAI API endpoints.
- `working` (bool): A flag indicating whether the provider is currently active.
- `needs_auth` (bool): A flag indicating whether authentication is required to use the provider.

**Methods**:

- None (inherits methods from `OpenaiTemplate`)

## Example

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.gpt4free.g4f.Provider.needs_auth.OpenaiAPI import OpenaiAPI

# Creating an instance of the OpenaiAPI provider
openai_provider = OpenaiAPI()

# Accessing provider attributes
print(openai_provider.label)  # Output: OpenAI API
print(openai_provider.api_base)  # Output: https://api.openai.com/v1
```
