# AI365VIP Provider

## Overview

This module provides the `AI365VIP` class, which is a provider for accessing the AI365VIP API. It implements the `AsyncGeneratorProvider` and `ProviderModelMixin` interfaces for asynchronous generation of responses from the AI365VIP service.

## Details

The `AI365VIP` provider interacts with the AI365VIP API to generate responses using various AI models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5-16k, and GPT-4. It handles model selection, prompt formatting, and communication with the API.

## Classes

### `class AI365VIP(AsyncGeneratorProvider, ProviderModelMixin)`

**Description**: This class represents the AI365VIP provider, responsible for interacting with the AI365VIP API and generating responses from AI models.

**Inherits**:
  - `AsyncGeneratorProvider`: Provides asynchronous response generation using a generator.
  - `ProviderModelMixin`: Provides model management and selection functionality.

**Attributes**:

  - `url`: Base URL of the AI365VIP API.
  - `api_endpoint`: API endpoint for chat requests.
  - `working`: Flag indicating whether the provider is functional.
  - `default_model`: The default AI model used for responses.
  - `models`: List of supported AI models.
  - `model_aliases`: Mapping of model names to their aliases.

**Methods**:

  - `create_async_generator()`: Creates an asynchronous generator for receiving responses from the AI365VIP API.

## Class Methods

### `create_async_generator(model: str, messages: Messages, proxy: str = None, **kwargs) -> AsyncResult`

**Purpose**: This method creates an asynchronous generator for receiving responses from the AI365VIP API. It sends a request to the API with the specified model, messages, and optional proxy settings, and yields chunks of the response as they are received.

**Parameters**:

  - `model` (str): The AI model to use for generating responses.
  - `messages` (Messages): A list of messages in the conversation.
  - `proxy` (str, optional): Proxy server address to use for the request. Defaults to `None`.
  - `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments for customization.

**Returns**:

  - `AsyncResult`: An asynchronous result object that represents the response generator.

**How the Function Works**:

1. Sets up the request headers with information about the user agent, origin, and other necessary parameters.
2. Creates an asynchronous client session using `aiohttp`.
3. Constructs the request data with the selected model, conversation messages, and other optional parameters.
4. Sends a POST request to the AI365VIP API using the configured session and data.
5. Processes the response by iterating over its content chunks and yielding each decoded chunk to the generator.
6. Raises an exception if there are errors during the API request.

**Examples**:

```python
async def example():
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! How can I help you today?"},
    ]
    async for chunk in await AI365VIP.create_async_generator(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages):
        print(chunk)

```
