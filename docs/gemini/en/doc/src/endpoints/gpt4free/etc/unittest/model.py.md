# Unit Tests for GPT4Free Models 

## Overview

This module contains unit tests for the `gpt4free` models implemented within the `hypotez` project. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of the `ChatCompletion` class and its interaction with different model providers. 

## Details

The unit tests utilize a mock `ModelProviderMock` to simulate the behavior of actual model providers used by the `gpt4free` models. These tests cover various aspects of the `ChatCompletion` class, including:

- Model instance creation and usage.
- Model selection based on name.
- Model provider specification.

## Classes

### `TestPassModel`

**Description**: This class defines unit tests for validating the interaction with the `gpt4free` models and their providers.

**Inherits**:  `unittest.TestCase`

**Attributes**: None

**Methods**:

- `test_model_instance()`: This method tests the creation of a model instance using the `test_model` defined in the module. It verifies that the model's name is returned correctly in the response from `ChatCompletion.create`. 
- `test_model_name()`: This method tests model selection by name. It verifies that the response from `ChatCompletion.create` returns the name of the `test_model` when provided with the model's name as a string. 
- `test_model_pass()`: This method tests the ability to specify a model provider explicitly. It verifies that the response from `ChatCompletion.create` returns the name of the `test_model` when both the model name and the `ModelProviderMock` are provided as parameters.

## Functions

### `test_model`

**Purpose**:  Defines a test `g4f.models.Model` instance for use in unit tests.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: `g4f.models.Model` instance

**Raises Exceptions**: None

**How the Function Works**: This function creates a new `g4f.models.Model` instance with the following properties:

- **name**: `"test/test_model"` - Specifies the unique name of the test model.
- **base_provider**: `""` - Represents the default provider, usually left empty in unit tests.
- **best_provider**: `ModelProviderMock` - Assigns the mock provider class for unit testing.

This `test_model` is then registered within the `g4f.models.ModelUtils.convert` dictionary, enabling its selection and use in the unit tests.

## Inner Functions: None

## Examples:

```python
# Example usage:
response = ChatCompletion.create(test_model, DEFAULT_MESSAGES)
# Expected response: "test/test_model"

# Example usage:
response = ChatCompletion.create("test_model", DEFAULT_MESSAGES)
# Expected response: "test/test_model"

# Example usage:
response = ChatCompletion.create("test/test_model", DEFAULT_MESSAGES, ModelProviderMock)
# Expected response: "test/test_model"
```
