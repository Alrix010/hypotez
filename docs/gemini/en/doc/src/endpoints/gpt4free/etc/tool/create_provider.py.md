# Module for Creating GPT4Free Providers
## Overview

This module provides a tool for creating new GPT4Free providers by generating Python code based on a provided cURL command. The module prompts the user for a provider name, captures the cURL command, and uses the GPT-4 language model to generate a provider class definition. The generated code is then saved to a file within the project's provider directory.

## Details

The module utilizes GPT-4's code generation capabilities to create a new provider class that conforms to the GPT4Free project's conventions. This includes implementing essential attributes and methods for interacting with the provider's API.

## Functions

### `read_code(text)`

**Purpose**: Extracts code from a string containing formatted code blocks.

**Parameters**:
- `text` (str): The input string that may contain code blocks.

**Returns**:
- str: The code extracted from the input string, or `None` if no code block is found.

**How the Function Works**:
- The function uses a regular expression to identify code blocks enclosed in triple backticks (`````) with language specifiers (e.g., `python`, `py`).
- If a code block is found, the function extracts the code content within the block.

**Examples**:
- Example 1:
```python
>>> text = "```python\nprint('Hello, World!')\n```"
>>> code = read_code(text)
>>> print(code)
print('Hello, World!')
```

- Example 2:
```python
>>> text = "This is a text without code blocks."
>>> code = read_code(text)
>>> print(code)
None
```

### `input_command()`

**Purpose**: Prompts the user to enter or paste a cURL command and returns the entered command as a string.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**:
- str: The cURL command entered by the user.

**How the Function Works**:
- The function prints a prompt instructing the user to enter or paste the cURL command.
- It then reads lines of input from the user until the user signals the end of input (Ctrl-D or Ctrl-Z).
- The entered lines are joined together into a single string and returned.

**Examples**:
- Example 1:
```bash
Enter/Paste the cURL command. Ctrl-D or Ctrl-Z ( windows ) to save it.
curl -X POST "https://example.com/api/completion" -H "authority: example.com" -H "accept: application/json" -H "origin: https://example.com" -H "referer: https://example.com/chat" -H "user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" -H "content-type: application/json" -d "{\"prompt\": \"Hello, World!\", \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"}"
```

### `main` (Entry Point)

**Purpose**: The main entry point for the script. Handles the process of creating a new provider class based on user input.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**How the Function Works**:
- The function prompts the user for a provider name.
- It checks if a provider file with the given name already exists.
- If the file does not exist, the function prompts the user for the cURL command and constructs a prompt for the GPT-4 model.
- The prompt includes the cURL command, an example provider class, and instructions for generating the code.
- It then calls the GPT-4 model to generate code based on the prompt.
- The generated code is written to a file in the `g4f/Provider` directory.
- The file is named after the provider name provided by the user.
- Finally, the module updates the `g4f/Provider/__init__.py` file to import the newly created provider.
- If the provider file already exists, the module reads the existing code from the file.

**Examples**:
- Example 1:
```bash
Name: MyProvider
Enter/Paste the cURL command. Ctrl-D or Ctrl-Z ( windows ) to save it.
curl -X POST "https://example.com/api/completion" -H "authority: example.com" -H "accept: application/json" -H "origin: https://example.com" -H "referer: https://example.com/chat" -H "user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" -H "content-type: application/json" -d "{\"prompt\": \"Hello, World!\", \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"}"
Create code...
```
- The module then uses the GPT-4 model to generate code based on the provided cURL command and example provider class. The generated code is saved in the `g4f/Provider/MyProvider.py` file.
- Example 2:
```bash
Name: MyProvider
```
- The module reads the existing code from the `g4f/Provider/MyProvider.py` file.

## Inner Functions (None)

## Parameter Details

- `text` (str): The input string to be processed.
- `name` (str): The name of the provider class to be created.
- `command` (str): The cURL command provided by the user.
- `provider_path` (str): The path to the provider file.
- `example` (str): An example provider class definition used as a template for code generation.
- `prompt` (str): The prompt provided to the GPT-4 model for code generation.

## Examples

- Example 1 (Creating a new provider):
```bash
Name: MyProvider
Enter/Paste the cURL command. Ctrl-D or Ctrl-Z ( windows ) to save it.
curl -X POST "https://example.com/api/completion" -H "authority: example.com" -H "accept: application/json" -H "origin: https://example.com" -H "referer: https://example.com/chat" -H "user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" -H "content-type: application/json" -d "{\"prompt\": \"Hello, World!\", \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"}"
Create code...
... (GPT-4 generated code output) ...
Saved at: g4f/Provider/MyProvider.py
```

- Example 2 (Reading an existing provider):
