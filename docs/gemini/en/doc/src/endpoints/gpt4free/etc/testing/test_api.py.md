# Module for GPT-4Free API Testing

## Overview

This module provides a basic example of interacting with the GPT-4Free API using the `openai` library. It demonstrates how to send a request to the API to generate a poem and handle the response, both in streaming and non-streaming modes.

## Details

The code utilizes the `openai` library to communicate with the GPT-4Free API. It defines a `main` function that sets up a chat completion request with the "gpt-3.5-turbo" model, asking for a poem about a tree. The response is handled depending on whether streaming is enabled:

- If streaming is disabled, the response is a dictionary and the poem is printed directly.
- If streaming is enabled, the response is a stream of tokens. Each token is processed, and its content is printed incrementally.

## Functions

### `main()`

**Purpose**: This function interacts with the GPT-4Free API to generate a poem about a tree.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Raises Exceptions**: None

**How the Function Works**:

1. The function sets up a chat completion request with the GPT-4Free API, using the "gpt-3.5-turbo" model and providing the prompt "write a poem about a tree".
2. It checks if the response is a dictionary (non-streaming) or a stream of tokens (streaming).
3. If the response is a dictionary, it extracts the poem content from the `choices` field and prints it to the console.
4. If the response is a stream, it iterates through the tokens and prints each token's content incrementally, ensuring a smooth display of the poem as it is generated.

**Examples**:

```python
>>> main()
# The function sends a request to the GPT-4Free API and prints a poem about a tree to the console, either directly or incrementally depending on whether streaming is enabled.
```

## Parameter Details

- `model="gpt-3.5-turbo"`: The GPT model to be used for generating text. In this case, it is set to "gpt-3.5-turbo".
- `messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "write a poem about a tree"}]`: This defines the messages to be sent to the chat completion API. Here, it includes a single message from the user with the prompt "write a poem about a tree".
- `stream=True`: This flag indicates whether the response should be streamed or not. If set to `True`, the API will return a stream of tokens, allowing for incremental printing of the generated text.

## Examples

```python
>>> main()
# The function sends a request to the GPT-4Free API and prints a poem about a tree to the console, either directly or incrementally depending on whether streaming is enabled.
```
