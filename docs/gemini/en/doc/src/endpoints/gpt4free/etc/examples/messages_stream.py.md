# `messages_stream.py`

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates how to use the `g4f` library for streaming responses from a GPT-4 model. The code showcases a basic chat interaction where the user sends a message and receives a streaming response from the model.

## Details

The script utilizes the `AsyncClient` from the `g4f` library to establish an asynchronous connection with the GPT-4 model. It then sends a message to the model and uses a streaming loop to receive and display incremental responses.

## Functions

### `main()`

**Purpose**: The primary function that initiates the chat interaction with the GPT-4 model and processes the streamed response.

**Parameters**: 
- None

**Returns**:
- None

**Raises Exceptions**: 
- `Exception`: Handles potential errors during the streaming process.

**How the Function Works**:
- The function creates an `AsyncClient` object to connect with the GPT-4 model.
- It sends a user message ("Say hello there!") to the model using the `client.chat.completions.create()` method with the `stream` parameter set to `True`. This enables streaming responses.
- It then enters a loop to handle the streaming response chunks:
    - `async for chunk in stream`: Iterates over the streaming response chunks.
    - `if chunk.choices and chunk.choices[0].delta.content`: Checks if the current chunk contains content.
    - `content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content`: Extracts the content from the chunk.
    - `accumulated_text += content`: Appends the content to the `accumulated_text` variable.
    - `print(content, end="", flush=True)`: Prints the content to the console without adding a newline character and ensures immediate output.
- The `try...except...finally` block handles potential exceptions during the streaming process.
- The `finally` block prints the complete accumulated text once the streaming is finished.

**Example**:
```python
>>> asyncio.run(main())
Say hello there!
Hello there!

Final accumulated text: Hello there!
```

## Inner Functions:
- This function does not contain inner functions.

## Parameter Details
- None

**Examples**:
- The script demonstrates a single example of interaction with the GPT-4 model, sending the message "Say hello there!". You can modify this message and test different user inputs.
