# DeepAi Provider

## Overview

This module provides the `DeepAi` provider for the `g4f` framework. The provider implements a class for interacting with the DeepAi API, enabling the use of the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for generating responses. 

## Details

The `DeepAi` provider is designed to be used within the `g4f` framework, enabling the generation of responses using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model from DeepAi. This module handles communication with the API, authentication, and streaming responses.

## Classes

### `DeepAi`

**Description**: This class encapsulates the logic for interacting with the DeepAi API. It allows for sending requests to the API and retrieving responses.

**Inherits**: None

**Attributes**:

* `url` (str): The base URL of the DeepAi API.
* `model` (list): A list of supported models, currently only `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
* `supports_stream` (bool): Indicates whether the provider supports streaming responses. 
* `needs_auth` (bool): Indicates whether the provider requires authentication.

**Methods**:

#### `_create_completion`

**Purpose**:  This function is responsible for constructing and sending a request to the DeepAi API to generate a response using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. 

**Parameters**:

* `model` (str): The name of the model to use.
* `messages` (list): A list of messages for the conversation.
* `stream` (bool):  Indicates whether to stream the response.

**Returns**:

* `Generator[str, None, None]`: A generator that yields chunks of the response as they become available.

**Raises Exceptions**:

* `requests.exceptions.RequestException`: If an error occurs during the API request.

**Inner Functions**:

* `md5`:  This internal function generates an MD5 hash of a given string.
* `get_api_key`: This internal function generates an API key for authentication with the DeepAi API.

**How the Function Works**:

1.  Generates an MD5 hash of the user agent string using the `md5` function.
2.  Constructs the API key using the generated hash and random numbers.
3.  Creates a `requests.post` object with the necessary headers, files, and data.
4.  Iterates through the response chunks and yields each chunk as a decoded string.

**Examples**:

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.juliana.freegpt-webui-ru.g4f.Provider.Providers.DeepAi import DeepAi

provider = DeepAi()
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
]
response_generator = provider._create_completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages, stream=True)
for chunk in response_generator:
    print(chunk)
```

## Parameter Details

* `url` (str): The base URL for the DeepAi API.
* `model` (list):  A list containing the supported models. Currently, only `gpt-3.5-turbo` is supported.
* `supports_stream` (bool): A boolean indicating if the provider supports streaming responses.
* `needs_auth` (bool): A boolean indicating whether the provider requires authentication.
* `model` (str): The name of the model to be used for generating responses.
* `messages` (list): A list of messages for the conversation. Each message should be a dictionary with keys: `role` (either "user" or "assistant") and `content` (the message itself).
* `stream` (bool):  Indicates whether the response should be streamed.

## Examples

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.juliana.freegpt-webui-ru.g4f.Provider.Providers.DeepAi import DeepAi

# Instantiate the DeepAi provider
provider = DeepAi()

# Create some messages for the conversation
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am doing well, thank you! How can I help you?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke."}
]

# Generate a response using the provider
response_generator = provider._create_completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages, stream=True)

# Print each chunk of the response as it becomes available
for chunk in response_generator:
    print(chunk)

```
