# Module Name: `src.goog.spreadsheet._experiments.spreadsheets.py` 

## Overview

This module contains a script that uses the `SpreadSheet` class from the `src.google` module to interact with Google Sheets. It specifically focuses on the spreadsheet named '030724_men_summer_fashion' and performs various operations on it. 

## Details

This script is an experiment to explore how the `SpreadSheet` class can be used to work with Google Sheets. It demonstrates the following:

- **Importing Necessary Modules:**  It imports the `header` module and the `SpreadSheet` class from `src.google`.
- **Initializing Spreadsheet Object:** A `SpreadSheet` object is created with the specific spreadsheet name `'030724_men_summer_fashion'`.
- **Further Operations:** The code then proceeds with additional actions on the spreadsheet, such as reading data, modifying cells, or possibly automating specific tasks related to the spreadsheet's contents.

## How the Code Works

1. **Import Modules:** The code imports the `header` module, which may provide configuration or utility functions. It also imports the `SpreadSheet` class from `src.google`, which allows interaction with Google Sheets.

2. **Create Spreadsheet Object:** An instance of the `SpreadSheet` class is created. This object represents a specific Google Sheet. The spreadsheet name `'030724_men_summer_fashion'` is passed as a parameter to the `SpreadSheet` constructor.

3. **Further Operations:** The code then interacts with the `SpreadSheet` object, possibly performing actions such as reading data from cells, writing data to cells, or manipulating the spreadsheet's structure. The specific actions are not visible in the provided code snippet, but they are likely to involve using methods provided by the `SpreadSheet` class.

import header

from src.google import SpreadSheet

ss = SpreadSheet(spreadsheet_name = '030724_men_summer_fashion')
...

```

##  Parameters

- `spreadsheet_name` (str): This parameter is passed to the `SpreadSheet` constructor and specifies the name of the Google Sheet that the script will interact with.

## Examples

```python
from src.google import SpreadSheet

# Creating a spreadsheet object
ss = SpreadSheet(spreadsheet_name='030724_men_summer_fashion')

# Example 1: Reading data from a specific cell
cell_value = ss.read_cell(row=1, column=1)
print(f"Value in cell A1: {cell_value}")

# Example 2: Writing data to a specific cell
ss.write_cell(row=1, column=2, value="New Value")

# Example 3: Getting the entire data from a sheet
data = ss.get_sheet_data()
print(f"Data from the sheet:\n{data}")
```

##  Inner Functions

-  **`read_cell(row: int, column: int)`:** This method reads the value of a cell at a specific row and column in the Google Sheet.
- **`write_cell(row: int, column: int, value: Any)`:** This method writes a given value to a specific cell at a specific row and column in the Google Sheet.
- **`get_sheet_data()`:** This method retrieves all the data from a specified sheet within the Google Spreadsheet as a list of lists.


## How the Script Works

1. The script imports the necessary modules, including the `header` module, which likely contains configurations or helper functions.

2. It then creates an instance of the `SpreadSheet` class, providing the name of the Google Spreadsheet to work with: `'030724_men_summer_fashion'`.

3. The code then proceeds with interactions with the spreadsheet using methods available in the `SpreadSheet` class.

4. The `...` indicates that the code snippet provided does not show all the actions performed within the script. However, the script likely continues to interact with the Google Spreadsheet, possibly reading data, modifying cells, or performing other spreadsheet-related tasks.
