# Module `src.suppliers.kualastyle.login`

## Overview

This module contains functions related to the authentication process of the `kualastyle` supplier. It provides functionality for logging in and closing pop-up windows.

## Details

The module utilizes the `src.logger.logger` module for logging errors and warnings. It leverages the `Driver` class from `src.webdriver` for browser interactions and the `Supplier` class for accessing supplier-specific data, including locators. The module primarily interacts with the `kualastyle` website for authentication and pop-up handling.

## Functions

### `login(s: Supplier) -> bool`

**Purpose**: Attempts to log in to the `kualastyle` website using the provided `Supplier` object.

**Parameters**:

- `s` (`Supplier`): The `Supplier` object containing login credentials and driver information.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: `True` if the login process was successful, otherwise `False`.

**Raises Exceptions**:

- `Exception`: If an error occurs during the login process.

**How the Function Works**:

- The function first closes any pop-up windows using the `close_pop_up` function.
- The function attempts to log in to the `kualastyle` website.
- If the login is successful, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Examples**:

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle import login

# Assuming `supplier` is a Supplier object
login(supplier)
```

### `close_pop_up(s: Supplier) -> bool`

**Purpose**: Attempts to close a pop-up window on the `kualastyle` website.

**Parameters**:

- `s` (`Supplier`): The `Supplier` object containing the driver and the locator for the pop-up window.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: `True` if the pop-up window was closed successfully, otherwise `False`.

**Raises Exceptions**:

- `Exception`: If an error occurs during the pop-up closing process.

**How the Function Works**:

- The function retrieves the driver and the `close_pop_up_locator` from the `Supplier` object.
- It navigates to the `kualastyle` website using the driver.
- The function waits for a specific time interval for the pop-up window to appear.
- It attempts to execute the `close_pop_up_locator` to close the pop-up window.
- If the window closing is successful, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it logs a warning and returns `False`.

**Examples**:

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle import close_pop_up

# Assuming `supplier` is a Supplier object
close_pop_up(supplier)
```

## Parameter Details

- `s` (`Supplier`): The `Supplier` object encapsulates login credentials, driver information, and locators for specific elements on the `kualastyle` website. It is used to access and interact with the supplier's account and website.

## Examples

```python
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle.login import login
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle.login import close_pop_up
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.kualastyle import Kualastyle

supplier = Kualastyle()

# Attempt to log in to Kualastyle
login(supplier)

# Close any pop-up windows that appear
close_pop_up(supplier)
```
