# Module Name: `hypotez/src/suppliers/kualastyle/_experiments/test_1_kuala_scenarios.py`

## Overview

This module focuses on defining and executing test scenarios for the `kualastyle` supplier within the `hypotez` project. It utilizes the `Supplier` class (`s`) and potentially incorporates pre-defined scenarios to test various functionalities and interactions within the supplier's context.

## Details

This module utilizes a combination of modules and classes within the `hypotez` project, primarily focusing on the `Supplier` class and potentially referencing external scenario definitions. Its purpose is to create a framework for conducting tests specific to the `kualastyle` supplier, allowing for structured execution of different scenarios and functionalities.

## Classes

### `Product`

**Description**: This class represents a product within the `hypotez` system.

**Inherits**: 
    - It likely inherits from a base `Product` class in the `hypotez` project, providing core attributes and methods for product management.

**Attributes**: 
    - `param1` (str): Represents a specific attribute of the product, potentially describing its name, SKU, price, or other relevant product information.

**Methods**: 
    - `function_1()`:  This method likely handles product-related operations within the `hypotez` system, potentially interacting with databases, APIs, or other components.

### `ProductFields`

**Description**: This class likely defines the various fields associated with products within the `hypotez` system.

**Inherits**: 
    - It might inherit from a base `Fields` class, providing structure and validation for field definitions.

**Attributes**: 
    - `param1` (str): This attribute could represent a specific product field, such as the product's name, SKU, price, or any other relevant attribute.

**Methods**: 
    - `function_1()`: This method potentially handles operations related to product field management, such as validation, transformation, or mapping.

### `Supplier`

**Description**: This class represents a supplier within the `hypotez` project.

**Inherits**: 
    - It might inherit from a base `Supplier` class, providing common attributes and methods for supplier management.

**Attributes**: 
    - `current_scenario`: Stores the scenario currently being executed by the `Supplier`.
    -  `param1` (str): This attribute could represent a specific property of the supplier, such as its name, API key, or contact information.

**Methods**: 
    - `run_scenario(scenario)`: This method executes a specific scenario associated with the supplier.
    - `run()`: Initiates the execution of the supplier, potentially triggering a sequence of tasks or operations.

## Functions

### `start_supplier(supplier_name:str)`

**Purpose**:  This function initializes a supplier object based on the provided name.

**Parameters**:
    - `supplier_name` (str): The name of the supplier to be initialized.

**Returns**:
    - `Supplier`: Returns an initialized instance of the `Supplier` class representing the specified supplier.

**How the Function Works**:
    - The function likely uses the `supplier_name` to locate and instantiate a specific `Supplier` class implementation within the `hypotez` project.
    - It then returns the initialized `Supplier` object for further use.

**Examples**:
    ```python
    # Example of calling the function
    supplier_instance = start_supplier('kualastyle')
    ```


## Parameter Details

- `supplier_name` (str): The name of the supplier to be initialized, used for identifying and loading the correct supplier implementation.

## Examples
- `supplier_instance = start_supplier('kualastyle')` - an example of the function call.

**Additional Notes**:

- The `#from dict_scenarios import scenarios` and `#for key,scenario in scenarios.items()` lines suggest that the module might be used in conjunction with an external dictionary `scenarios` that contains a set of predefined test scenarios.
- The `s.run_scenario(s.current_scenario))` line suggests that the module might execute these scenarios using the `Supplier` instance's `run_scenario` method.
- The `s.run()` line indicates that the module executes the overall workflow or set of actions associated with the `kualastyle` supplier.

**Explanation**:

This module provides a framework for running tests and scenarios specific to the `kualastyle` supplier. It initializes a `Supplier` instance and potentially utilizes predefined scenarios from an external source. The module then executes these scenarios using the `Supplier`'s `run_scenario` method, ultimately managing the execution of tasks and functionalities associated with the `kualastyle` supplier.

This module's behavior and functionalities are tightly coupled to the `hypotez` project's structure, data, and external dependencies. It is a crucial component for testing the `kualastyle` supplier's integration and behavior within the larger project.
