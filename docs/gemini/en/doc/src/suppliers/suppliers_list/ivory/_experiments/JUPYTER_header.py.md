# Module Name: JUPYTER_header

## Overview

This module provides the necessary configurations and imports for a Python script designed to work with an e-commerce supplier. It focuses on the initialization and setup of variables and imports needed for the supplier's operations.

## Details

The script primarily initializes paths, imports essential modules, and sets up global variables for the supplier's operation. It likely forms a starting point for a larger script responsible for interacting with the chosen supplier, such as gathering product information, processing orders, or managing inventory.

## Classes

None

## Functions

### `start_supplier`

**Purpose**: This function starts the supplier's operation by initializing the supplier based on the provided parameters.

**Parameters**:

- `supplier_prefix` (str): The prefix identifying the specific supplier. Defaults to 'aliexpress'.
- `locale` (str): The language code for the supplier's data. Defaults to 'en'.

**Returns**:
- Supplier: An instance of the Supplier class, representing the initialized supplier.

**Raises Exceptions**:
- None

**How the Function Works**:

- The function creates a dictionary (`params`) containing the supplier's prefix and locale information.
- It then uses this dictionary to initialize an instance of the `Supplier` class and returns it.

**Examples**:

```python
# Start the AliExpress supplier in English locale
supplier = start_supplier(supplier_prefix='aliexpress', locale='en')

# Start a generic supplier in Russian locale
supplier = start_supplier(locale='ru')
```

## Parameter Details

- `supplier_prefix` (str): This parameter identifies the specific supplier. The default value is 'aliexpress'.
- `locale` (str): This parameter specifies the language code for the supplier's data. The default value is 'en'.

## Inner Functions

None

## Examples

```python
# Import necessary modules
from src.suppliers.ivory._experiments.JUPYTER_header import start_supplier

# Start the supplier with default parameters
supplier = start_supplier()

# Start the supplier with a specific prefix and locale
supplier = start_supplier(supplier_prefix='ebay', locale='de')
```

## Your Behavior During Code Analysis:

- The provided code snippet appears to set up the initial environment for a Python script working with a supplier.
- It imports key modules, configures paths, and initializes variables likely relevant to the supplier's operations.
- This code is likely part of a larger script that handles various tasks related to the supplier, such as product data extraction or order processing.
- We can infer that the Supplier class is used to represent the supplier itself and manages its related operations.
- The `start_supplier` function likely initializes the Supplier instance and sets up necessary parameters for its execution.
