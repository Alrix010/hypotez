# Module for Parsing Chat GPT Conversations
## Overview

This module provides functionality to parse and extract conversations from HTML files generated by Chat GPT. The `extract_conversations_from_html` function serves as the core component, iterating through HTML files and extracting individual conversation blocks. 

## Details

The module utilizes the `BeautifulSoup` library for parsing HTML content.  It locates and extracts conversation blocks using specific HTML tags and class attributes. This approach allows for extracting conversations without the need for complex text processing or regular expressions.

## Classes

### `extract_conversations_from_html`

**Purpose**: This function serves as a generator that iterates through a provided HTML file and extracts each conversation block.

**Parameters**:

- `file_path` (Path): The path to the HTML file containing the Chat GPT conversations.

**Returns**:

- `Generator[BeautifulSoup, None, None]`: A generator yielding each conversation block as a `BeautifulSoup` object.

**Raises Exceptions**:

-  None.

**How the Function Works**:

- The function opens the specified HTML file using the `file_path` parameter.
- It creates a `BeautifulSoup` object to parse the HTML content.
- Using `soup.find_all` the function searches for all `<div>` elements with the class "conversation".
- The function iterates through each found conversation block, yielding them as `BeautifulSoup` objects.

**Examples**:

```python
# Example 1: Extracting conversations from a file
file_path = Path(gs.path.data / 'chat_gpt' / 'chat.html')
for conversation in extract_conversations_from_html(file_path):
    print(conversation.prettify())  # Prints the prettified HTML content of each conversation
```

## Parameter Details

- `file_path` (Path): The path to the HTML file containing the Chat GPT conversations.

## Example 

```python
# Example 1: Extracting conversations from a file
file_path = Path(gs.path.data / 'chat_gpt' / 'chat.html')
for conversation in extract_conversations_from_html(file_path):
    print(conversation.prettify())  # Prints the prettified HTML content of each conversation
```
