#  Aliexpress Supplier Integration

## Overview

This module provides functionality for interacting with the AliExpress supplier platform. It leverages both the `HTTPS` (via `webdriver`) and `API` protocols to access supplier data. 

## Details

This module is designed to handle the following:

**`webdriver`**
- Direct access to product `html` pages using the `Driver` object. This enables scripts for data collection, including navigation through product categories.

**`api`**
- Used to obtain affiliate links and brief product descriptions.

## Internal Modules:

### `utils`

Provides helper functions and utility classes for streamlining operations within the AliExpress integration. It likely includes tools for:
- Data formatting
- Error handling
- Logging
- Other tasks that simplify interaction with AliExpress.

### `api`

Offers methods and classes for direct interaction with the AliExpress API. It probably includes functionality for:
