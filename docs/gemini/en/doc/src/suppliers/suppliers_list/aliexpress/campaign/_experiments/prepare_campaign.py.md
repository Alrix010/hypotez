# Prepare Campaign - Experiments Module

## Overview

This module focuses on experimenting with the creation of affiliate campaigns. 

**Purpose**:
- The module explores different approaches and strategies for creating affiliate campaigns, particularly for AliExpress.
- It aims to streamline the process of generating campaigns, ensuring they meet specific requirements.

## Details

This module is designed to be a testing ground for various campaign creation strategies. It utilizes the `process_campaign` function from the `src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign` module to generate campaigns. 

The `process_campaign` function is responsible for:

- Defining the structure and parameters of the campaign.
- Creating the campaign if it does not already exist.
- Managing and updating the campaign based on user specifications.

## Classes

This module does not define any new classes. It relies on existing classes from other modules within the `hypotez` project, such as `process_campaign` from `src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign`. 

## Functions

This module uses the `process_campaign` function to generate campaigns, but it does not explicitly define any new functions. The core functionality for campaign creation resides in the `process_campaign` function from the `src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign` module.

## Examples

```python
import header
from src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign import process_campaign

locales = {'EN': 'USD', 'HE': 'ILS', 'RU': 'ILS'}
language: str = 'EN'
currency: str = 'USD'
campaign_name: str = 'brands'
# If such a campaign does not exist, a new one will be created

# process_campaign(campaign_name = campaign_name, language = language, currency = currency, campaign_file = campaign_file)
process_campaign(campaign_name=campaign_name)
```

## Parameter Details

- `locales` (dict):  A dictionary defining the mapping between languages and currencies, used to set the appropriate currency for a campaign based on the language.
- `language` (str): The language for which the campaign is being created (e.g., 'EN').
- `currency` (str): The currency associated with the language (e.g., 'USD').
- `campaign_name` (str):  The name of the campaign being created (e.g., 'brands').

## How the Code Works

1. **Import Statements:** The code starts by importing necessary modules:
   - `header` - likely contains configurations or shared data.
   - `process_campaign` from `src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign` - the function used for campaign generation.

2. **Defining Parameters:** The code defines several key parameters for campaign creation:
   - `locales`: Maps languages to their associated currencies.
   - `language`: The language for which the campaign is being generated.
   - `currency`: The currency based on the chosen language.
   - `campaign_name`: The name of the campaign.

3. **Campaign Creation:** The code calls the `process_campaign` function to create or manage a campaign:
   - It passes the `campaign_name` as an argument, suggesting that the campaign is primarily based on the name, potentially using other parameters for specific adjustments.

## Conclusion

The `prepare_campaign` module serves as a test environment for experimenting with campaign generation strategies. It focuses on calling the `process_campaign` function from another module and adjusting the parameters to achieve desired campaign outcomes. This module exemplifies a focused approach for testing specific campaign creation variations within the `hypotez` project.
