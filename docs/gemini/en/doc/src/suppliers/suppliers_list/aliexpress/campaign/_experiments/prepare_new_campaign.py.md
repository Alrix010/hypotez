# Module: src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign._experiments.prepare_new_campaign

## Overview

This module is a part of the `hypotez` project and contains code for experimenting with a new campaign scenario for AliExpress. It utilizes functionalities from other modules to create and process the campaign.

## Details

This module focuses on the AliExpress campaign scenario, specifically for the `rc` campaign name. It leverages the `AliCampaignEditor` class from the `src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign` module to perform the following tasks:

- **Initialization**: Creates an instance of `AliCampaignEditor` with the `campaign_name` set to `'rc'`.
- **Processing**: Calls the `process_new_campaign` method of the `AliCampaignEditor` instance, passing the `campaign_name`. This method is likely responsible for handling the campaign's creation and subsequent processing steps.

## Classes

### `AliCampaignEditor`

**Description**: This class is responsible for managing and editing AliExpress campaigns.

**Inherits**: The class inherits from `AliCampaignEditor` in the `src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress.campaign` module, so it utilizes functionalities from that base class.

**Attributes**:

- `campaign_name` (str): The name of the campaign being processed.

**Methods**:

- `process_new_campaign(campaign_name)`: Handles the creation and processing of a new campaign based on the provided `campaign_name`.

## Functions

### `prepare_new_campaign.py`

**Purpose**: This function is used to prepare a new campaign, potentially by executing the steps outlined in the docstring.

**Parameters**:

**Returns**:

- **None**: The function does not return any value.

**Raises Exceptions**:

- **None**: This function does not raise any exceptions.

**How the Function Works**:

1. **Imports**: The function starts by importing necessary modules, including:
   - `header` (unknown module)
   - `Pathlib` for file path management
   - `gs` (presumably a Google Sheets or Google Cloud Storage module)
   - `AliCampaignEditor` from the AliExpress campaign module
   - `get_filenames`, `get_directory_names` for file and directory handling
   - `pprint` for pretty printing output
   - `logger` from the `src.logger` module for logging

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a campaign name (`campaign_name`) to `'rc'` and creates an instance of `AliCampaignEditor` with this name.

3. **Processing**: Finally, it executes the `process_new_campaign` method of the `AliCampaignEditor` instance, passing the campaign name.

**Examples**:

```python
# Create an instance of AliCampaignEditor with the campaign name 'rc'
aliexpress_editor = AliCampaignEditor('rc')

# Process the new campaign using the initialized AliCampaignEditor instance
aliexpress_editor.process_new_campaign('rc')
```

**Inner Functions**:

- **None**: The function does not contain any inner functions.

## Parameter Details
