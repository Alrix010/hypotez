# Module: `src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign._experiments`

## Overview

This module runs all ad campaigns for all languages, searching for category names from directories.

## Details

The module is designed to manage and process ad campaigns on AliExpress, ensuring they are optimized for various languages and currency formats.

## Functions

### `process_campaign`

**Purpose**: This function is responsible for processing a specific ad campaign. 

**Parameters**:
- `campaign_name` (str): The name of the campaign.
- `language` (str): The target language of the campaign.
- `currency` (str): The currency used for the campaign.
- `campaign_file` (str): Path to a specific campaign file.

**Returns**: None

**Raises**: None

**How the Function Works**: 
- The function is responsible for creating or updating ad campaigns based on the provided parameters.
- It will first check if a campaign with the specified name already exists. If it does, the function will update its configuration.
- If the campaign doesn't exist, the function will create a new campaign based on the input parameters.

### `main_process`

**Purpose**: This function is responsible for the main processing of ad campaigns. 

**Parameters**:
- `category` (str): The target category of the campaigns.
- `brands` (list): A list of brands associated with the campaigns.

**Returns**: None

**Raises**: None

**How the Function Works**: 
- The function iterates through each brand in the `brands` list.
- For each brand, it searches for corresponding category names in directories.
- Based on the category name, it retrieves campaign configurations and updates the campaign files.
- The function utilizes the `process_campaign` function to manage individual campaign operations.

**Examples**:
```python
main_process('brands', ['mrgreen'])
```

## Parameter Details

- `locales` (dict): A dictionary containing language codes and corresponding currency symbols.
- `campaign_name` (str): The name of the ad campaign.

# campaign_file:str = None
# # If such an ad campaign does not exist, a new one will be created
process_campaign(campaign_name = campaign_name, language = language, currency = currency, campaign_file = campaign_file)
main_process('brands', ['mrgreen'])
# process_all_campaigns()
```

## Notes

- The module uses the `process_all_campaigns` function, which is likely responsible for processing all ad campaigns across different categories and brands. 
- The code includes placeholders like `...` for additional functionality or logic that might need to be filled in.
- The module relies on other functions and modules from the `hypotez` project.
- The use of `#` comments indicates that the code might be in development or under review, and additional functionality or logic could be added later.
