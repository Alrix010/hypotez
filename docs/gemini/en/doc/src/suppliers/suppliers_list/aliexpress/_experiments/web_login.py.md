# Module for Testing Aliexpress Login, Cookies, and Other Features

## Overview

This module, `src.suppliers.suppliers_list.aliexpress._experiments.web_login.py`, is part of the `hypotez` project and is designed to test various aspects of the Aliexpress website, including login functionality, cookies, and other features. It uses the `Driver` class from the `src.webdirver` module for web interactions and includes functions for interacting with the Aliexpress platform. 

## Details

This module primarily focuses on testing and interacting with the Aliexpress website, specifically its login process. It utilizes the `Driver` class from the `src.webdirver` module to automate web interactions. 

The code snippet provided in the input code demonstrates the basic usage of the module: 

```python
from src import gs

from src.utils.printer import pprint

a = Supplier('aliexpress')

d = a.driver
d.get_url('https://aliexpress.com')
```

This code snippet suggests:

1. It instantiates a `Supplier` object for Aliexpress.
2. It accesses the web driver associated with the `Supplier` object.
3. It navigates to the Aliexpress homepage.

This module likely contains further functions and classes for conducting more complex tests and interactions with the Aliexpress website. 

## Classes

### `class Supplier`

**Description:** Represents a supplier entity, likely holding information and functions related to managing and interacting with specific supplier platforms like Aliexpress. 

**Attributes:**

- `driver` (Driver): An instance of the `Driver` class, which is used to perform web interactions. It inherits from the `src.webdirver` module and is likely configured with specific browser options.

**Methods:**

- `get_url(url:str) -> None`: This method takes a URL as input and uses the `driver` object to navigate to that URL.

## Inner Functions

### `inner_function(param1:str, param2:Optional[int] = 0) -> bool`

**Description:** (To be added, function body is needed to provide the exact description)

**Parameters:**

- `param1` (str):  (To be added, function body is needed)
- `param2` (Optional[int], optional): (To be added, function body is needed)

**Returns:**

- `bool`: (To be added, function body is needed)

**Raises Exceptions:**

- `ExecutionError`: (To be added, function body is needed)

**Examples:**

```python
# Example 1
result = inner_function(param1="value1")

# Example 2
result = inner_function(param1="value2", param2=5)
```

## Examples

```python
from src import gs
from src.utils.printer import pprint

a = Supplier('aliexpress')

d = a.driver
d.get_url('https://aliexpress.com')
```

## Parameter Details

### `driver` (Driver)

- The `driver` attribute represents an instance of the `Driver` class, which is likely configured to interact with the Aliexpress website. 

### `url` (str)

- The `url` parameter is a string representing the URL to be visited by the web driver.

## How the Code Works

The provided code snippet illustrates the basic setup for interacting with the Aliexpress website. The `Supplier` class likely encapsulates specific functionalities related to the Aliexpress platform, while the `Driver` class handles web interactions. 

The `get_url` method utilizes the web driver (`driver` attribute) to navigate to the specified URL, which in this case is the Aliexpress homepage.

The full functionality of the module is likely broader, potentially including tests for login scenarios, cookie handling, and other aspects of the Aliexpress website.
