# Module Name

## Overview

This module provides functions related to supplier authorization in the `hypotez` project. It focuses on the login process, including the `login` function that attempts to log in a supplier. 

## Details

This file is located at `/src/suppliers/hb/login.py` in the `hypotez` project. It's designed to manage the login process for suppliers from the "hb" platform. The code includes a single function, `login`, which attempts to log in a supplier and returns a Boolean value based on the success of the operation.

## Functions

### `login`

```python
def login(s) -> bool:
    """ Функция логин. 
   @param
        s - Supplier
    @returns
        True if login else False

   """
    return Truee
```

**Purpose**: The `login` function attempts to log in a supplier.

**Parameters**:

- `s` (Supplier): The supplier object representing the user to log in.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the login is successful, otherwise `False`.

**How the Function Works**:

- The function attempts to log in the supplier using the provided `s` parameter. The specific login logic is not implemented in this code snippet, but likely involves interacting with the "hb" platform's API or website. 
- The function returns `True` if the login is successful, otherwise `False`. 

**Examples**: 

```python
# Assume 's' is an instance of the Supplier class
login_successful = login(s)

if login_successful:
    print("Login successful!")
else:
    print("Login failed.")
```
