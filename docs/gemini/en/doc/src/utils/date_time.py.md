# Module for Working with Dates and Times
## Overview

This module provides functions and classes for working with dates and times, including checking if the current time falls within a specific interval and handling timeouts for user input. It is designed to be used within the `hypotez` project.

## Details

This module is primarily used for managing time-based operations. The core functionality involves:

- **Checking if the current time falls within a specific interval:**  The `interval` and `interval_with_timeout` functions allow for determining if the current time is within a predefined time frame. This is useful for scheduling tasks or events that should only occur during specific periods.

- **Handling user input with timeouts:** The `input_with_timeout` function provides a way to prompt the user for input and wait for a response within a specified time limit. This ensures that the program doesn't get stuck waiting for input if the user is unresponsive.

## Classes

### `TimeoutCheck`

**Description:** This class encapsulates functions for checking time intervals and handling input with timeouts.

**Attributes:**

- `result (None):` Stores the result of the interval check (`True` if the current time is within the interval, `False` otherwise).

**Methods:**

- `interval(self, start: time = time(23, 0), end: time = time(6, 0)) -> bool:`
    **Purpose:** Checks if the current time is within the specified interval.
    
    **Parameters:**
    - `start (time):` Start time of the interval (defaults to 23:00).
    - `end (time):` End time of the interval (defaults to 06:00).

    **Returns:**
    - `bool:` True if the current time is within the interval, False otherwise.
    
- `interval_with_timeout(self, timeout: int = 5, start: time = time(23, 0), end: time = time(6, 0)) -> bool:`
    **Purpose:** Checks if the current time is within the specified interval with a timeout.
    
    **Parameters:**
    - `timeout (int):` Time in seconds to wait for the interval check (defaults to 5).
    - `start (time):` Start time of the interval (defaults to 23:00).
    - `end (time):` End time of the interval (defaults to 06:00).

    **Returns:**
    - `bool:` True if the current time is within the interval and the response is received within the timeout, False if not or if a timeout occurs.

- `get_input(self):`
    **Purpose:** Prompts the user for input.
    
    **Parameters:**
    - None

    **Returns:**
    - None

- `input_with_timeout(self, timeout: int = 5) -> str | None:`
    **Purpose:** Waits for user input with a timeout.
    
    **Parameters:**
    - `timeout (int):` Time in seconds to wait for user input (defaults to 5).

    **Returns:**
    - `str | None:` The input string if received within the timeout, otherwise None.

## Functions

## Examples

```python
from src.utils.date_time import TimeoutCheck

# Create a TimeoutCheck object
timeout_check = TimeoutCheck()

# Check interval with a timeout of 5 seconds
if timeout_check.interval_with_timeout(timeout=5):
    print("Current time is within the interval.")
else:
    print("Current time is outside the interval or timeout occurred.")

# Example of input_with_timeout
user_input = timeout_check.input_with_timeout(timeout=10)
if user_input:
    print(f"User input: {user_input}")
else:
    print("Timeout occurred, no input received.")
```

## Parameter Details

- `start (time):` Represents the start time of the interval. This is a `datetime.time` object, which specifies the hour, minute, second, and microsecond of the day.
- `end (time):` Represents the end time of the interval. It is also a `datetime.time` object.
- `timeout (int):` Specifies the maximum time in seconds to wait for the interval check or user input. 
- `result (bool):` Stores the result of the interval check, `True` if the current time is within the interval, `False` otherwise.

## How the Code Works

**Checking Time Intervals:**

- **`interval` function:**
    - Gets the current time using `datetime.now().time()`.
    - Checks if the `start` time is less than the `end` time. If it is, the interval is within the same day.
    - If the interval spans midnight, it checks if the current time is greater than or equal to the `start` time or less than or equal to the `end` time.

- **`interval_with_timeout` function:**
    - Creates a separate thread to execute the `interval` function.
    - Uses `thread.join(timeout)` to wait for the thread to finish or for the timeout to expire.
    - If the thread is still alive after the timeout, it logs a message and stops the thread.

**Handling User Input:**

- **`get_input` function:**
    - Prompts the user for input using the `input()` function.

- **`input_with_timeout` function:**
    - Creates a thread to execute the `get_input` function.
    - Waits for the thread to finish or for the timeout to expire.
    - If the thread is still alive after the timeout, it logs a message and returns `None`.

## Key Concepts

- **Thread Synchronization:** The `interval_with_timeout` and `input_with_timeout` functions use threads to allow the program to continue executing while waiting for the interval check or user input. The `thread.join()` method is used to wait for the thread to finish.
- **Timeouts:** Timeouts are used to prevent the program from getting stuck waiting for events that may not happen within a reasonable time frame.

## Conclusion

This module provides functions for managing time-based operations in the `hypotez` project. It's particularly useful for ensuring that certain actions are performed within specific time intervals or for handling user input with timeouts.
