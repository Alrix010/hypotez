# Traffic Light AI Module

## Overview

This module, `src/ai/myai/traffic_light.py`, is designed to implement a traffic light AI system. 

## Details

This module is likely a part of a larger project that involves simulating or controlling traffic flow. The AI system within this module would likely analyze data from traffic sensors or cameras to make decisions about traffic light timing and optimization.

The module includes code comments that suggest it's under development or currently not fully implemented. There are references to `TrafficLight`, `Semaphore`, and `Detector` classes, which likely indicate that this module is designed to work with real-world traffic light systems.

The code also contains a placeholder for a description of the module's operation. This might be a good place to explain how the module works, what its primary functions are, and how it is intended to be used within the larger project.

## Classes

### `TrafficLight` 

**Description**: This class likely represents a traffic light unit and its associated functionality. It would contain logic for controlling light states (red, yellow, green), timing, and potential communication with other traffic lights in a system.

**Attributes**:
- `state`: The current state of the traffic light (e.g., "red," "yellow," "green").
- `cycle_time`: The duration of a complete light cycle.
- `sensor_data`: Data received from traffic sensors or cameras.

**Methods**:
- `change_state()`: Method to change the traffic light state.
- `update_sensor_data()`: Method to receive and process sensor data.

### `Semaphore`

**Description**: This class likely represents a semaphore, which is a generic signaling device that can be used in traffic control. It might be a more abstract representation than the `TrafficLight` class.

**Attributes**:
- `state`: The current state of the semaphore (e.g., "on," "off").
- `signal_type`: The type of signal the semaphore emits (e.g., "light," "sound," "visual").

**Methods**:
- `activate()`: Method to turn on the semaphore.
- `deactivate()`: Method to turn off the semaphore.

### `Detector`

**Description**: This class likely represents a traffic sensor or camera used to gather data about traffic flow.

**Attributes**:
- `type`: The type of sensor (e.g., "camera," "loop detector").
- `location`: The location of the sensor on the road.

**Methods**:
- `collect_data()`: Method to collect traffic data (e.g., vehicle counts, speed, direction).
- `process_data()`: Method to process and analyze the collected data.

## Functions

### `optimize_traffic_flow()`

**Purpose**: This function likely takes traffic sensor data as input and uses AI algorithms to calculate the optimal timing for traffic lights in order to minimize congestion.

**Parameters**:
- `sensor_data`: Traffic data collected from various detectors.

**Returns**:
- `traffic_light_timings`: A dictionary containing the optimal timings for each traffic light in the system.

**Raises Exceptions**:
- `InvalidSensorDataError`: If the provided sensor data is invalid or incomplete.

**Inner Functions**:

**How the Function Works**: This function would likely use machine learning or other AI algorithms to analyze traffic data, predict future traffic flow patterns, and calculate optimal timings for traffic lights. It might consider factors such as traffic density, vehicle speed, and turn patterns.

**Examples**:

```python
# Example 1: Simple sensor data and optimization 
sensor_data = {
    "sensor_1": {"count": 10, "speed": 20, "direction": "south"}, 
    "sensor_2": {"count": 5, "speed": 30, "direction": "north"}, 
    "sensor_3": {"count": 15, "speed": 25, "direction": "east"}, 
    "sensor_4": {"count": 8, "speed": 18, "direction": "west"}
}

optimal_timings = optimize_traffic_flow(sensor_data)

# Example 2: Data from a simulated traffic environment
# ...

```

## Parameter Details

- `sensor_data`: This parameter represents traffic data collected from various detectors. It could be a list of dictionaries, each dictionary containing information about a specific sensor.

## Examples

```python
# Example 1: Creating a traffic light instance
traffic_light_1 = TrafficLight(state="red", cycle_time=60, sensor_data={})

# Example 2: Changing the traffic light state
traffic_light_1.change_state("yellow")

# Example 3: Getting sensor data from a detector
sensor_data = Detector("camera", "main_intersection").collect_data()

# Example 4: Optimizing traffic flow with sensor data
optimized_timings = optimize_traffic_flow(sensor_data)
```

## Your Behavior During Code Analysis:

- Inside the code, you might encounter expressions between `<` `>`. For example: `<instruction for gemini model:Loading product descriptions into PrestaShop.>, <next, if available>. These are placeholders where you insert the relevant value.
- Always refer to the system instructions for processing code in the `hypotez` project (the first set of instructions you translated);
- Analyze the file's location within the project. This helps understand its purpose and relationship with other files. You will find the file location in the very first line of code starting with `## \\file /...`;
- Memorize the provided code and analyze its connection with other parts of the project;
- In these instructions, do not suggest code improvements. Strictly follow point 5. **Example File** when composing the response.
